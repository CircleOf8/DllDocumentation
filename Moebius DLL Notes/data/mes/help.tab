TAG_COMBAT_ACTIONS	TAG_COMBAT			Combat Actions	There are many actions a character can take during combat.  All actions have an ~action cost~[TAG_ACTION_COST].  Some actions provoke ~attacks of opportunity~[TAG_AOO].[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_AID_ANOTHER	TAG_SPECIAL_ATTACKS			Aid Another	In combat, you can help a friend attack or defend by distracting or interfering with opponents.  Select a friendly target.  That target gains a +2 bonus to his attack rolls until your next turn.You can also use this action to wake a friend under the influence of a ~sleep~[TAG_SPELLS_SLEEP] spell.  Aiding another is a ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION] which does not provoke an ~attack of opportunity~[TAG_AOO].    
TAG_AOO	TAG_COMBAT			Attack Of Opportunity	A single extra ~melee attack~[TAG_MELEE_ATTACKS] per round that a combatant can make when an opponent within reach takes an action which provokes an attack of opportunity.  Actions which provoke attacks of opportunity include casting a spell, using a ranged weapon, and moving through a threatened area.In Greyhawk: Temple of Elemental Evil all characters automatically make the first attack of opportunity which presents itself.
TAG_ARMOR_CLASS	TAG_COMBAT			Armor Class (AC)	Armor Class (AC) is a number representing a character's ability to avoid being hit in combat.  Higher numbers are better.  An opponent's attack roll must equal or exceed the target's Armor Class to hit it.  A character's Armor Class is 10 + all applicable modifiers (typically armor bonus, shield bonus, dexterity modifier, and size modifier).
TAG_ABILITIES				Abilities	[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_ABILITY_SCORES	TAG_ABILITIES			Ability Scores	Ability scores are created by rolling four six-sided dice. For each of the six ~abilities~[TAG_THE_ABILITIES] roll the four dice, disregarding the lowest die roll and totalling the three highest ones. The result is a number between 3 (horrible) and 18 (tremendous). The average ability score for a typical commoner is 10 or 11, but your characters are not typical.Your rolls will be displayed on screen. If you are unhappy with them, you have the option of rolling again (not in the ~Ironman Mode~[TAG_IRONMAN] however) until you are satisfied with them. You then will need to assign the six die rolls to that character's ~abilities~[TAG_THE_ABILITIES].After each assigned die roll, the ~ability modifier~[TAG_ABILITY_MODIFIERS] will be displayed. Finally, it is important for spellcasters to know which ability governs bonus spells for their particular type of magic. ~Wizards~[TAG_WIZARDS] use ~intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE]; ~clerics~[TAG_CLERICS], ~druids~[TAG_DRUIDS], ~paladins~[TAG_PALADINS], and ~rangers~[TAG_RANGERS] use ~wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM]; ~sorcerers~[TAG_SORCERERS] and ~bards~[TAG_BARDS] use ~charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA]. If the spellcaster's abilitiy score is 10 or lower, you will not be able to cast spells tied to that ability.
TAG_THE_ABILITIES	TAG_ABILITIES			The Abilities	[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_STRENGTH	TAG_THE_ABILITIES			Strength	Strength measures your character's muscle and physical power. This ability is especially important for ~fighters~[TAG_FIGHTERS], ~barbarians~[TAG_BARBARIANS], ~paladins~[TAG_PALADINS], ~rangers~[TAG_RANGERS], and ~monks~[TAG_MONKS] because it helps them prevail in combat. Strength also limits the amount of ~equipment~[TAG_EQUIPMENT] your characters can carry.You apply your character's Strength modifier to:-- Melee attack rolls-- Damage rolls when using a melee weapon or a thrown weapon-- Strength checks (for breaking down doors and the like). 
TAG_DEXTERITY	TAG_THE_ABILITIES			Dexterity	Dexterity measures hand-eye coordination, agility, reflexes, and balance. This ability is the most important one for ~rogues~[TAG_ROGUES], but it is also high on the list for characters who typically wear light or medium armor (~rangers~[TAG_RANGERS] or ~barbarians~[TAG_BARBARIANS]) or no armor at all (~monks~[TAG_MONKS], ~wizards~[TAG_WIZARDS], or ~sorcerers~[TAG_SORCERERS]), and for anyone who wants to be a skilled archer.You apply your character's Dexterity modifier to:-- Ranged attack rolls, including those for attacks made with light crossbows (~light crossbow~[TAG_WEAPONS_CROSSBOW_LIGHT] or ~heavy crossbows~[TAG_WEAPONS_CROSSBOW_HEAVY]), ~throwing axes~[TAG_WEAPONS_AXE_THROWING], and other ranged weapons.-- ~Armor Class (AC)~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS], provided that the character can react to the attack.-- ~Reflex~[TAG_REFLEX] ~saving throws~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] for avoiding ~fireballs~[TAG_SPELLS_FIREBALL] and other attacks that you can escape by moving quickly.-- ~Hide~[TAG_HIDE], ~Move Silently~[TAG_MOVE_SILENTLY], ~Open Lock~[TAG_OPEN_LOCK], and ~Sleight of Hand~[TAG_SLEIGHT]. These are the ~skills~[TAG_SKILLS] that have Dexterity as their key ability.
TAG_CONSTITUTION	TAG_THE_ABILITIES			Constitution	Constitution represents your character's health and stamina. A Constitution bonus increases a character's hit points, so the ability is important for all classes.You apply your character's Constitution modifier to:-- Each roll of a Hit Die (though a die roll can never drop below 1 due to a penalty)-- ~Fortitude~[TAG_FORTITUDE] ~saving throws~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] for resisting poison and similar threats.-- Concentration checks. ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION] is a skill, important to spellcasters, that has Constitution as its key ability.If a character's Constitution score changes enough to alter his or her Constitution modifier, the character's hit points also increase or decrease accordingly.
TAG_INTELLIGENCE	TAG_THE_ABILITIES			Intelligence	Intelligence determines how well your character learns and reasons. This ability is important for ~wizards~[TAG_WIZARDS] because it affects how many spells they can cast, how hard their spells are to resist, and how powerful their spells can be. It's also important for any character who wants to have a wide assortment of skills.You apply your character's Intelligence modifier to:-- The number of skill points gained each level. (But your characters always get at least 1 skill point per level.)-- ~Appraise~[TAG_APPRAISE], ~Disable Device~[TAG_DISABLE_DEVICE], ~Search~[TAG_SEARCH], and ~Spellcraft~[TAG_SPELLCRAFT] checks. These are the ~skills~[TAG_SKILLS] that have Intelligence as their key ability.A wizard gains bonus spells based on her Intelligence score. The minimum Intelligence score needed to cast a wizard spell is 10 + the spell's level.An animal has an Intelligence score of 1 or 2. A creature of humanlike intelligence has a score of at least 3.
TAG_WISDOM	TAG_THE_ABILITIES			Wisdom	Wisdom describes a character's willpower, common sense, perception, and intuition. While ~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE] represents one's ability to analyze information, Wisdom represents being in tune with and aware of one's surroundings. An "absentminded professor" has low Wisdom and high Intelligence. A simpleton (low Intelligence) might still have great insight (high Wisdom). Wisdom is the most important ability for ~clerics~[TAG_CLERICS] and ~druids~[TAG_DRUIDS], and it is also important for ~paladins~[TAG_PALADINS] and ~rangers~[TAG_RANGERS]. If you want your character to have acute senses, put a high score in Wisdom. Every creature has a Wisdom score.You apply your character's Wisdom modifier to:-- ~Will~[TAG_WILL] ~saving throws~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] (for negating the effects of charm person and other spells).-- ~Heal~[TAG_HEAL], ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN], ~Sense Motive~[TAG_SENSE_MOTIVE], ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT], and ~Survival~[TAG_SURVIVAL] checks. These are the ~skills~[TAG_SKILLS] that have Wisdom as their key ability.Clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers get bonus spells based on their Wisdom scores. The minimum Wisdom score needed to cast a cleric, druid, paladin, or ranger spell is 10 + the spell's level.
TAG_CHARISMA	TAG_THE_ABILITIES			Charisma	Charisma measures a character's force of personality, persuasiveness, personal magnetism, ability to lead, and physical attractiveness. This ability represents actual strength of personality, not merely how one is perceived by others in a social setting. Charisma is most important for ~paladins~[TAG_PALADINS], ~sorcerers~[TAG_SORCERERS], and ~bards~[TAG_BARDS]. It is also important for ~clerics~[TAG_CLERICS], since it affects their ability to turn undead. Every creature has a Charisma score. You apply your character's Charisma modifier to:-- ~Bluff~[TAG_BLUFF], ~Diplomacy~[TAG_DIPLOMACY], ~Gather Information~[TAG_GATHER_INFORMATION], ~Intimidate~[TAG_INTIMIDATE], ~Perform~[TAG_PERFORM], and ~Use Magic Device~[TAG_UMD] checks. These are the ~skills~[TAG_SKILLS] that have Charisma as their key ability.-- Checks that represent attempts to influence others.-- Turning checks for clerics and paladins attempting to turn zombies, vampires, and other undead.Sorcerers and bards get bonus spells based on their Charisma scores. The minimum Charisma score needed to cast a sorcerer or bard spell is 10 + the spell's level.
TAG_CHANGE_ABILITY_SCORES	TAG_ABILITIES			Changing Ability Scores	Over time, the ability scores your character starts with can change. Ability scores can increase with no limit. Points at which ability changes occur include the following:-- Add 1 point to any score at 4th level and at every fourth level your character attains (4th and 8th levels in The Temple of Elemental Evil).-- Many spells and magical effects temporarily increase or decrease ability scores. -- Several magical items improve ability scores as long as the character is using them. -- Some rare magical items can boost an ability score permanently. Such an increase is called an inherent bonus. An ability  score cannot have an inherent bonus of more than +5.-- Poisons, diseases, and other effects can temporarily harm an ability. Ability points lost to damage return on their own at a rate of 1 point per day for each damaged ability.-- Some effects drain abilities, resulting in a permanent loss. Points lost this way don't return on their own, but they can be regained with spells.Note that when an ability score changes, all attributes asscociated with that score change accordingly, including the ~ability modifier~[TAG_ABILITY_MODIFIERS].
TAG_ABILITY_MODIFIERS  	TAG_ABILITY_SCORES			Ability Modifiers	Each ability, after changes made because of ~race~[TAG_RACES], has a modifier ranging from -5 to +5. The modifier is the number you apply to the die rolls when your character tries to do something related to that ability.Ability Score     Modifier-----------------     ----------    1                           @t-5    2-3                       @t-4    4-5                       @t-3     6-7                       @t-2    8-9                       @t-1    10-11                   @t0    12-13                  @t+1    14-15                  @t+2    16-17                  @t+3    18-19                  @t+4    20-21                  @t+5    
TAG_RACES				Races	[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_RACIAL_CHARACTERISTICS	TAG_RACES			Racial Characteristics	Your character's race determines some of his or her qualities.Depending on what race you choose, your character's abilities may be modified by ability adjustments. Each race has a favored class, which comes into play for characters choosing to ~multiclass~[TAG_MULTICLASS].
TAG_HUMANS	TAG_RACES			Humans	Most humans are the descendants of pioneers, conquerors, traders, travelers, refugees, and other people on the move. As a result, human lands are home to a mix of people--physically, culturally, religiously, and politically different. Hardy or fine, light-skinned or dark, showy or austere, primitive or civilized, devout or impious, humans run the gamut.Physical Description: Humans typically stand from 5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and weigh from 125 to 250 pounds, with men noticeably taller and heavier than women. Humans have short life spans, reaching adulthood at about age 15 and rarely living even a single century.Alignment: Humans tend toward no particular alignment, not even neutrality. The best and the worst are found among them.Religion: Unlike members of the other common races, humans do not have a chief racial deity. ~Pelor~[TAG_PELOR], the sun god, is the most commonly worshiped deity in human lands, but he can claim nothing like the central place that the dwarves give ~Moradin~[TAG_MORADIN] or the elves give ~Corellon Larethian~[TAG_CORELLON] in their respective pantheons. Racial Traits:-- Medium: As Medium creatures, humans have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.-- Human base land speed is 30 feet.-- 1 extra feat at 1st level.-- 4 extra skill points at 1st level and 1 extra skill point at each additional level.-- Favored Class: Any. When determining whether a multiclass human takes an experience point penalty, her highest-level class does not count.
TAG_DWARVES	TAG_RACES			Dwarves	Dwarves are known for their skill in warfare, their ability to withstand physical and magical punishments, their knowledge of the earth's secrets, their hard work, and their capacity for drinking ale. Their mysterious kingdoms, carved from the insides of mountains, are renowned for the marvelous treasures that they produce as gifts for trade.Physical Description: Dwarves stand only 4 to 4 1/2 feet tall, but they are so broad and compact that they are, on average, almost as heavy as humans. Dwarf men are slightly taller and noticeably heavier than dwarf women. Dwarf men value their beards and groom them very carefully. Dwarves are considered adults at about age 40, and they can live to be more than 400 years old.Alignment: Dwarves are usually lawful, and they tend toward good. Adventuring dwarves are less likely to fit the common mold, however, since they're more likely to be those who didn't fit perfectly into dwarven society.Religion: The chief deity of the dwarves is ~Moradin~[TAG_MORADIN], the Soul Forger. He is the creator of the dwarves, and he expects his followers to work for the betterment of the dwarf race.Racial Traits:-- +2 ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION], -2 ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA]-- Medium: As Medium creatures, dwarves have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.-- Dwarves' base land speed is 20 feet. However, dwarves can move at this speed even when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load.-- Weapon Familiarity: Dwarves may treat dwarven waraxes as martial weapons rather than exotic weapons.-- Stability: +4 bonus on ability checks made to resist being bull rushed or tripped when standing on the ground.-- +2 racial bonus on ~saving throws~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] against poison.-- +2 racial bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like effects.-- +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against orcs and goblinoids.-- +4 dodge bonus to ~Armor Class~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS] against creatures of the giant type (such as ogres, trolls, and hill giants).-- +2 racial bonus on ~Appraise~[TAG_APPRAISE] checks that are related to stone or metal items.-- Favored Class: ~Fighter~[TAG_FIGHTERS]. A multiclass dwarf's fighter class does not count when determining whether he takes an experience point penalty for multiclassing.
TAG_ELVES	TAG_RACES			Elves	Elves mingle freely in human lands, always welcome yet never at home there. They are well known for their poetry, dance, song, lore, and magical arts. Elves favor things of natural and simple beauty. When danger threatens their woodland homes, however, elves reveal a more martial side, demonstrating skill with sword, bow, and battle strategy.Physical Description: Elves are short and slim, standing about 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 feet tall and typically weighing 85 to 135 pounds, with elf men the same height as and only marginally heavier than elf women. They are graceful but frail. An elf reaches adulthood at about 110 years of age and can live to be more than 700 years old. Elves do not sleep, as members of other common races do. Instead, an elf meditates in a deep trance for 4 hours a day.Alignment: Since elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. Generally, they value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. Religion: Above all others, elves worship ~Corellon Larethian~[TAG_CORELLON], the Protector and Preserver of life. Elven myth holds that it was from his blood, shed in battle with ~Gruumsh~[TAG_GRUUMSH], the god of the orcs, that the elves first arose.Racial Traits:-- +2 ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY], -2 ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION]-- Medium: As Medium creatures, elves have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.-- Immunity to magic sleep spells and effects, and a +2 racial saving throw bonus against enchantment spells or effects.-- Weapon Proficiency: Elves receive the Martial Weapon Proficiency feats for the ~longsword~[TAG_WEAPONS_LONGSWORD], ~rapier~[TAG_WEAPONS_RAPIER], ~longbow~[TAG_WEAPONS_LONGBOW], and ~shortbow~[TAG_WEAPONS_SHORTBOW] as bonus feats. -- +2 racial bonuses on ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN], ~Search~[TAG_SEARCH], and ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT] checks. An elf who merely passes within 5 feet of a secret or concealed door is entitled to a Search check to notice it as if she were actively looking for it.-- Favored Class: ~Wizard~[TAG_WIZARDS]. A multiclass elf's wizard class does not count when determining whether she takes an experience point penalty for multiclassing.
TAG_GNOMES	TAG_RACES			Gnomes	Gnomes are welcome everywhere as technicians, alchemists, and inventors. Despite the demand for their skills, most gnomes prefer to remain among their own kind, living in comfortable burrows beneath the rolling, wooded hills where animals abound.Physical Description: Gnomes stand about 3 to 3 1/2 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Gnomes reach adulthood at about age 40, and they typically live about 350 years, though some can live almost 500 years.Alignment: Gnomes are most often good. Those who tend toward law are sages, engineers, researchers, scholars, or investigators. Those who tend toward chaos are minstrels or wanderers. Gnomes are good-hearted, and even the tricksters among them are more playful than vicious. Evil gnomes are as rare as they are frightening. Religion: The chief gnome god is ~Garl Glittergold~[TAG_GARL], the Watchful Protector. Racial Traits:-- +2 ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION], -2 ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH].-- Small: As a Small creature, a gnome gains a +1 size bonus to ~Armor Class~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS], a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 bonus on ~Hide~[TAG_HIDE] checks, but he must use smaller weapons than humans use, and his lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of a Medium character.-- Gnome base land speed is 20 feet.-- +2 racial bonus on saving throws against illusions.-- Add +1 to the Difficulty Class for all saving throws against illusion spells cast by gnomes. -- +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against kobolds and goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears).-- +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against creatures of the giant type (such as ogres, trolls, and hill giants).-- +2 racial bonus on ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN] checks.-- Spell-Like Abilities: Once per day -- speak with animals. --Favored Class: ~Bard~[TAG_BARDS]. A multiclass gnome's bard class does not count when determining whether he takes an experience point penalty.
TAG_HALF_ELVES	TAG_RACES			Half-Elves	Humans and elves sometimes wed, the elf attracted to the human's energy and the human to the elf's grace. These marriages end quickly because a human's life is so brief (compared to an elf's life span of hundreds of years), but they leave an enduring legacy -- half-elf children. The life of a half-elf can be hard. Most find places for themselves eventually in human lands, but some feel like outsiders all their lives.Physical Description: Half-elf height ranges from under 5 feet to about 6 feet tall, and weight usually ranges from 90 to 180 pounds. Half-elf men are taller and heavier than half-elf women, but the difference is less pronounced than that found among humans. A half-elf reaches adulthood at age 20 and can live to be more than 180 years old.Alignment: Half-elves share the chaotic bent of their elven heritage, but, like humans, they tend toward good and evil in equal proportion. Like elves, they value personal freedom and creative expression, demonstrating neither love of leaders nor desire for followers. They chafe at rules, resent others' demands, and sometimes prove unreliable, or at least unpredictable. Religion: Half-elves raised among elves follow elven deities, principally ~Correlon Larethian~[TAG_CORELLON]. Those raised among humans follow ~Ehlonna~[TAG_EHLONNA].Racial Traits:-- Medium: As Medium creatures, half-elves have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.-- Half-elf base land speed is 30 feet.-- Immunity to sleep spells and similar magical effects, and a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against enchantment spells or effects.-- +1 racial bonus on ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN], ~Search~[TAG_SEARCH], and ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT] checks. A half-elf does not have the elf's ability to notice secret doors simply by passing near them.-- +2 racial bonus on ~Diplomacy~[TAG_DIPLOMACY] and ~Gather Information~[TAG_GATHER_INFORMATION] checks.-- Favored Class: Any. When determining whether a multiclass half-elf takes an experience point penalty, her highest-level class does not count.
TAG_HALF_ORCS	TAG_RACES			Half-Orcs	In the wild frontiers, tribes of humans and orc barbarians live in uneasy balance, fighting in times of war and trading in times of peace. Half-Orcs who are born in the frontier may live with either human or orc parents, but they are nevertheless exposed to both cultures. Some, for whatever reasons, leave their homeland and travel to civilized lands, bringing with them the tenacity, courage, and combat prowess that they developed in the wilds.Physical Description: Half-orcs stand between 6 and 7 feet tall and usually weigh between 200 and 250 pounds. Many half-orcs have scars, whether as symbols of pride or shame. Half-orcs mature a little faster than humans and age noticeably faster. They reach adulthood at age 14, and few live longer than 75 years.Alignment: Half-orcs inherit a tendency toward chaos from their orc parents, but, like their human parents, they favor good and evil in equal proportions. Half-orcs raised among orcs and willing to live out their lives with them are usually the evil ones.Religion: Like orcs, many half-orcs worship ~Gruumsh~[TAG_GRUUMSH], the chief orc god and archenemy of ~Corellon Larethian~[TAG_CORELLON], god of the elves. Half-orcs who want to solidify their connection to their human heritage, on the other hand, follow human gods, and they may be outspoken in their shows of piety.Racial Traits:-- +2 ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH], -2 ~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE], -2 ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA].-- Medium: As Medium creatures, half-orcs have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.-- Half-orc base land speed is 30 feet.-- Favored Class: ~Barbarian~[TAG_BARBARIANS]. A multiclass half-orc's barbarian class does not count when determining whether he takes an experience point penalty.
TAG_HALFLINGS	TAG_RACES			Halflings	Halflings are clever, capable opportunists. Halfling individuals and clans find room for themselves wherever they can. Often they are strangers and wanderers, and others react to them with suspicion or curiosity. Depending on the clan, halflings might be reliable, hardworking citizens, or they might be thieves just waiting for the opportunity to make a big score and disappear in the dead of night. Regardless, halflings are cunning and resourceful survivors.Physical Description: Halflings stand about 3 feet tall and usually weigh between 30 and 35 pounds. A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 and usually lives into the middle of her second century.Alignment: Halflings tend to be neutral. While they are comfortable with change (a chaotic trait), they also tend to rely on intangible constants, such as clan ties and personal honor (a lawful trait). Religion: The chief halfling deity is ~Yondalla~[TAG_YONDALLA], the Blessed One, protector of the halflings. Halflings also recognize countless lesser gods, who rule over individual villages, forests, rivers, lakes, and so on. The halflings pay homage to these deities to ensure safe journey as they travel from place to place.Racial Traits: +2 ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY], -2 ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH].-- Small: As a Small creature, a halfling gains a +1 size bonus to ~Armor Class~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS], a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 bonus on ~Hide~[TAG_HIDE] checks, but she must use smaller weapons than humans use, and her lifting and carrying limits are three quarters of those of a Medium character.-- Halflings' base land speed is 20 feet.-- +2 racial bonus on ~Move Silently~[TAG_MOVE_SILENTLY] checks.-- +1 racial bonus on all ~saving throws~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC].-- +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear. This bonus stacks with the halfling's +1 bonus on saving throws in general.-- +1 racial attack bonus with thrown weapons and slings.-- +2 racial bonus on ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN] checks.-- Favored Class: ~Rogue~[TAG_ROGUES]. A multiclass halfling's rogue class does not count when determining whether she takes an experience point penalty for multiclassing.

TAG_LEVEL_BONUSES	TAG_CLASSES			Class and Level Bonuses	An attack roll, ~saving throw~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC], or skill check is a combination of three numbers, each representing a different factor: a random factor (the number you roll on a d20), a number representing the character's innate abilities (the ability modifier), and a bonus representing the character's experience and training. This third factor depends, either directly or indirectly, on the character's class and level.Base Save Bonus (BSB): As the character gains levels, this bonus increases for ~Fortitude~[TAG_FORTITUDE], ~Will~[TAG_WILL], and ~Reflex~[TAG_REFLEX] saving throws. Depending on the character's class, this increase can be either Good or Poor.Base Attack Bonus (BAB): As the character gains levels, this bonus adds to the attack roll. Depending on the character's class, this increase can be Good, Average, or Poor.  Additional attacks receive a reduced bonus.
TAG_CLASS_BENEFITS	TAG_CLASSES			Level-Dependent Benefits	Characters gain benefits from advancing in levels, in addition to those gained from their ~class and level benefits~[TAG_LEVEL_BONUSES]. Maximum Skill Ranks: A character's level determines the maximum allowable ranks he or she may have in ~Class Skills~[TAG_SKILLS] and Cross-Class Skills. The maximum ranks in Class Skills is the level plus 3, while the maximum level for Cross-Class Skills is half of that. ~Feats~[TAG_FEATS]: A character receives one feat at 1st level and another at every level divisible by three after that (3rd, 6th, and 9th). These feats are in addition to any bonus feats granted as class features.Ability Score Increase: Upon attaining any level divisible by four (4th and 8th), a character increases one of his or her ability scores by 1 point. The player chooses which ability score to improve.
TAG_BARBARIANS	TAG_CLASSES			Barbarians	From the frozen wastes of the north and the hellish jungles of the south come brave, even reckless warriors. Civilized people call them barbarians or berserkers and suspect them of mayhem, impiety, and atrocities. These "barbarians" have proven their mettle and their value to those who would be their allies.Characteristics: The barbarian is an excellent warrior. Where the ~fighter's~[TAG_FIGHTERS] skill in combat comes from training and discipline, however, the barbarian has a powerful ~rage~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARBARIAN_RAGE]. Barbarians are at home in the wild and they run at great speed.Alignment: Barbarians are never lawful. They may be honorable, but at heart they are wild. This wildness is their strength, and it could not live in a lawful soul. At best, barbarians of chaotic alignment are free and expressive. At worst, they are thoughtlessly destructive. Religion: Some barbarians distrust established religions and prefer an intuitive, natural relationship to the cosmos over formal worship. Others devote themselves to powerful deities, such as ~Kord~[TAG_KORD] (god of strength), ~Obad-Hai~[TAG_OBAD_HAI] (god of nature), or ~Erythnul~[TAG_ERYTHNUL] (god of slaughter). Other Classes: As people of the wild, barbarians are most comfortable in the company of ~rangers~[TAG_RANGERS], ~druids~[TAG_DRUIDS], and ~clerics~[TAG_CLERICS] of nature deities. Many barbarians admire the talents of ~bards~[TAG_BARDS] and are enthusiastic about music. However, barbarians don't trust what they don't understand, which includes the practices of ~wizards~[TAG_WIZARDS]. They are more tolerant toward ~sorcerers~[TAG_SORCERERS], perhaps because sorcerers are so charismatic. Barbarians have little in common with the practical, deliberate approach to combat that ~monks~[TAG_MONKS] take, but these two classes are not necessarily hostile to one another. Barbarians have no special attitude toward fighters, ~paladins~[TAG_PALADINS], clerics, or ~rogues~[TAG_ROGUES]. Role: A barbarian's typical primary role in a group of adventurers is as a front-line combat specialist. No other character can match a barbarian's sheer toughness. He can also serve as a good scout, thanks to his speed, skill selection, and trap sense. Abilities: ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] is important for barbarians because of its role in combat. ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] is also useful to barbarians, especially those who wear light armor. ~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM] is important for several of the barbarian's class skills. A high ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION] score lets a barbarian rage longer.Hit Die: d12Class ~Skills~[TAG_SKILLS]: ~Intimidate~[TAG_INTIMIDATE], ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN], and ~Survival~[TAG_SURVIVAL]Skill points at 1st Level: (4 x Int modifier) x 4Skill points at Each Additional Level: 4 + Int modifierClass Features:[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_BARDS	TAG_CLASSES			Bards	It is said that music has a special magic, and the bard proves that saying true. Wandering across the land, gathering lore, telling stories, working magic with his music, and living on the gratitude of his audience--such is the life of a bard. When change or opportunity draws them into a conflict, bards serve as diplomats, negotiators, scouts, and spies.Alignment: Bards are wanderers, guided by whim and intuition rather than by tradition or law. The spontaneous talent, magic, and lifestyle of the bard are incompatible with a lawful alignment. Other Classes: A bard works well with companions of other classes. She often serves as the spokesperson of the party, using her social skills for the party's benefit. In a party without a wizard or sorcerer, the bard contributes magic. In a party without a rogue, bards use their skills. Role: The bard is perhaps the ultimate generalist. In most adventuring groups, he works best in a supporting role. The bard makes all the other characters better at what they do, and can often fill in for another character when needed. Abilities: ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA] determines how powerful a spell a bard can cast, how many spells he can cast per day, and how hard those spells are to resist. Charisma, ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY], and ~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE] are important for many of the bard's class skills.Alignment: Any nonlawfulHid Die: d6Class ~Skills~[TAG_SKILLS]: ~Appraise~[TAG_APPRAISE], ~Bluff~[TAG_BLUFF], ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION], ~Diplomacy~[TAG_DIPLOMACY], ~Gather Information~[TAG_GATHER_INFORMATION], ~Hide~[TAG_HIDE], ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN], ~Move Silently~[TAG_MOVE_SILENTLY], ~Perform~[TAG_PERFORM], ~Sense Motive~[TAG_SENSE_MOTIVE], ~Sleight of Hand~[TAG_SLEIGHT], ~Spellcraft~[TAG_SPELLCRAFT], and ~Use Magic Device~[TAG_UMD].Skill Points at 1st Level: (6 + Int modifier) X 4Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 6 + Int modifierClass Features: [CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_CLERICS	TAG_CLASSES			Clerics	The handiwork of the gods is everywhere--in places of natural beauty, in mighty crusades, in soaring temples, and in the hearts of worshipers. Like people, gods can run the gamut from benevolent to malicious, reserved to intrusive, simple to inscrutable. The gods, however, work mostly through intermediaries--their clerics. Good clerics heal, protect, and avenge. Evil clerics pillage, destroy, and sabotage. Characteristics: Clerics are masters of ~divine magic~[TAG_DIVINE_SPELLS], a form of magic that is especially good with healing. Alignment: Like the gods they serve, clerics can be of any alignment. Because people more readily worship good deities than neutral or evil ones, there are more good than evil clerics. Clerics also tend toward law instead of chaos, since lawful religions tend to be more structured and better able to recruit and train clerics than chaotic ones. Typically, a cleric is the same alignment as his or her deity, though some clerics are one step away from their respective deities in alignment. A cleric may not be neutral (that is, neutral on both the good-evil axis and the lawful-chaotic axis) unless their deity is also neutral.Other Classes: In an adventuring party, the cleric is everybody's friend and often the glue that holds the party together, as well as the healer who channels divine energy to keep others alive. Clerics sometimes clash with ~druids~[TAG_DRUIDS], since druids represent an older, more primal relationship between the mortal and the divine. Mostly, though, the religion of a cleric and the god that he worships determines how he gets along with others.Role: The cleric serves as a typical group's primary healer, diviner, and defensive specialist. Clerics can hold their own in a fight, but are not usually well served by charging to the front of combat. Abilities: ~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM] determines how powerful a spell a cleric can cast, how many spells he can cast per day, and how hard those spells are to resist. A high ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION] score improves a cleric's hit points, and a high ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA] score improves his ability to turn undead.Alignment: A cleric's alignment must be within one step of his deity's.Hit Die: d8Class ~Skills~[TAG_SKILLS]: ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION],  ~Diplomacy~[TAG_DIPLOMACY], ~Heal~[TAG_HEAL], and ~Spellcraft~[TAG_SPELLCRAFT].~Domains~[TAG_DOMAINS] and Class Skills: A cleric who chooses the ~Travel~[TAG_TRAVEL_D] domain adds ~Survival~[TAG_SURVIVAL] to the list. A cleric who chooses the ~Trickery~[TAG_TRICKERY_D] domain adds ~Bluff~[TAG_BLUFF] and ~Hide~[TAG_HIDE] to the list. Skill Points at 1st Level: (2 + Int modifier) X 4Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modifierClass Features:[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_DRUIDS	TAG_CLASSES			Druids	The fury of a storm, the gentle strength of the morning sun, the cunning of the fox, the power of the bear--all these and more are at the druid's command. The druid, however, claims no mastery over nature. That claim, she says, is the empty boast of a city dweller. The druid gains her power not by ruling nature but by being at one with it. To a trespasser in a druid's sacred grove, and to those who feel her wrath, the distinction is overly fine.Abilities: ~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM] determines how powerful a spell a druid can cast, how many spells she can cast per day, and how hard those spells are to resist. To cast a spell, a druid must have a Wisdom score of 11 + the spell's level. A druid gets bonus spells based on Wisdom. The Difficulty Class of a saving throw against a druid's spell is 11 + the druid's Wisdom modifier. Since a druid wears only light or medium armor, a high ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] score greatly improves her defensive ability.Alignment: ~Neutral good~[TAG_NEUTRAL_GOOD], ~lawful neutral~[TAG_LAWFUL_NEUTRAL], ~neutral~[TAG_NEUTRAL], ~chaotic neutral~[TAG_CHAOTIC_NEUTRAL], or ~neutral evil~[TAG_NEUTRAL_EVIL].Hit Die: d8Class ~Skills~[TAG_SKILLS]: ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION],  ~Diplomacy~[TAG_DIPLOMACY], ~Heal~[TAG_HEAL], ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN], ~Spellcraft~[TAG_SPELLCRAFT], ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT], and ~Survival~[TAG_SURVIVAL].Skill Points at 1st Level: (4 + Int modifier) X 4Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 4 + Int modifierClass Features:[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_FIGHTERS	TAG_CLASSES			Fighters	The questing knight, the conquering overlord, the king's champion, the elite foot soldier, the hardened mercenary, and the bandit king--all are fighters. Fighters can be stalwart defenders of those in need, cruel marauders, or gutsy adventurers. Some are among the land's best souls, willing to face death for the greater good. Others are among the worst, with no qualms about killing for private gain, or even for sport. Fighters who are not actively adventuring may be soldiers, guards, bodyguards, champions, or criminal enforcers.Abilities: ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] is especially important for fighters because it improves their melee attack and damage rolls. ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION] is important for giving fighters many hit points, which they need in their frequent battles. ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] is important for fighters who want to be good archers or who want access to certain Dexterity-oriented feats, but the heavy armor that fighters usually wear reduces the benefits of a very high Dexterity score.Alignment: AnyHit Die: d10Class ~Skills~[TAG_SKILLS]: ~Intimidate~[TAG_INTIMIDATE]Skill Points at 1st Level: (2 + Int modifier) X 4Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modifierClass Features:[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_MONKS	TAG_CLASSES			Monks	Dotted across the landscape are monasteries--small, walled cloisters inhabited by monks who pursue personal perfection through action as well as contemplation. They train themselves to be versatile warriors skilled at fighting without weapons or armor. The inhabitants of monasteries headed by good masters serve as protectors of the people. In contrast, the residents of monasteries headed by evil masters rule the surrounding lands through fear, as an evil warlord and his entourage might. Characteristics: The key feature of the monk is her ability to fight unarmed and unarmored. Though a monk casts no spells, she has a magic of her own, called ki, which allows her to perform amazing feats. The monk's best known feat is her ability to stun an opponent with an unarmed blow. Other Classes: Monks do not have much in common with others, as their skills and motivation differ from those of most adventurers. However, monks realize that they work well with the support of others and they usually prove themselves reliable companions. Abilities: ~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM] powers the monk's special offensive and defensive capabilities. ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] provides an unarmored monk with a better defense and with bonuses to some class skills. ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] helps a monk's unarmed combat ability.Alignment: ~Lawful Good~[TAG_LAWFUL_GOOD], ~Lawful Neutral~[TAG_LAWFUL_NEUTRAL], ~Lawful Evil~[TAG_LAWFUL_EVIL]Hit Die: d8Class ~Skills~[TAG_SKILLS]: ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION],~Diplomacy~[TAG_DIPLOMACY], ~Hide~[TAG_HIDE], ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN], ~Move Silently~[TAG_MOVE_SILENTLY], ~Perform~[TAG_PERFORM], ~Sense Motive~[TAG_SENSE_MOTIVE], ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT], and ~Tumble~[TAG_TUMBLE].Skill Points at 1st Level: (4 + Int modifier) X 4Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 4 + Int modifierClass Features:[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_PALADINS	TAG_CLASSES			Paladins	The compassion to pursue good, the will to uphold law, and the power to defeat evil--these are the three weapons of the paladin. Few have the purity and devotion that it takes to walk the paladin's path, but those few are rewarded with the power to protect, to heal, and to smite. In a land of scheming wizards, unholy priests, bloodthirsty dragons, and infernal fiends, the paladin is the final hope that cannot be extinguished.Abilities: ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA] enhances a paladin's healing power, self-protective capabilities, and undead turning ability. ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] is important for the paladin because of its role in combat. A ~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM] score of 14 or higher is required to get access to the most powerful paladin spells, and a score of 11 or higher is required to cast any paladin spells at all.Alignment: ~Lawful good~[TAG_LAWFUL_GOOD]Hit Die: d10Class ~Skills~[TAG_SKILLS]: ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION],  ~Diplomacy~[TAG_DIPLOMACY], ~Heal~[TAG_HEAL], and ~Sense Motive~[TAG_SENSE_MOTIVE].Skill Points at 1st Level: (2 + Int modifier) X 4Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modifierClass Features:[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_RANGERS	TAG_CLASSES			Rangers	The forests are home to fierce and cunning creatures, such as bloodthirsty owlbears and malicious displacer beasts. But more cunning and powerful than these monsters is the ranger, a skilled hunter and stalker. He knows the woods as if they were his home (as indeed they are), and he knows his prey in deadly detail.Characteristics: A ranger can use a variety of weapons and is quite capable in combat. A ranger's skills allow him to survive in the wilderness, and he possesses special knowledge about certain creatures. Finally, an experienced ranger has such a tie to nature that he can actually draw upon natural power to cast divine spells, as a druid does. Alignment: Any. Most rangers are good, and they usually function as protectors of natural areas. They are also typically chaotic, preferring to follow the ebb and flow of nature or of their own hearts instead of rigid rules. Evil rangers are much to be feared as they gain spells to use nature for destructive purposes. Other Classes: Rangers get along well with ~druids~[TAG_DRUIDS] and to some extent with ~barbarians~[TAG_BARBARIANS]. They bicker most often with ~paladins~[TAG_PALADINS], who have a different style and approach to life that is much more bound by a code of morals and laws. Typically, though, rangers easily tolerate others, mostly because they don't feel the need to get upset over differences. Abilities: ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] is important for a ranger both because he tends to wear light armor and because several ranger skills are based on that ability. ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] is important because rangers frequently get involved in combat. Several ranger skills are based on ~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM], and a Wisdom score of 14 or higher is required to get access to the most powerful ranger spells. A Wisdom score of 11 or higher is required to cast any ranger spells at all. One of the ranger's trademark skills, his ability to ~track~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_RANGER_TRACK] foes, is based on Wisdom.Alignment: AnyHit Die: d8Class ~Skills~[TAG_SKILLS]: ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION], ~Heal~[TAG_HEAL], ~Hide~[TAG_HIDE], ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN], ~Move Silently~[TAG_MOVE_SILENTLY], ~Search~[TAG_SEARCH], ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT], and ~Survival~[TAG_SURVIVAL].Skill Points at 1st Level: (6 + Int modifier) X 4Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 6 + Int modifierClass Features:[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_ROGUES	TAG_CLASSES			Rogues	Rogues have little in common with one another. Some are stealthy thieves. Others are silver-tongued tricksters. Still others are scouts, infiltrators, spies, diplomats, or thugs. What they do share is versatility, adaptability, and resourcefulness. In general, rogues are skilled at getting what others don't want them to get: entrance into a locked treasure vault, safe passage past a deadly trap, secret battle plans, a guard's trust, or some random person's pocket money.Characteristics: Rogues are highly skilled and they can concentrate on developing any of several categories of skills. A rogue knows how to hit where it hurts and she can dish out a lot of damage with a ~sneak attack~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_SNEAK_ATTACK]. Alignment: Any. Rogues follow opportunities, not ideals. Though they are more likely to be chaotic than lawful, they are a diverse bunch, so they can be of any alignment. Other Classes: Rogues excel when protected by warriors and spellcasters, but they are wary of the sometimes overbearing disposition of ~paladins~[TAG_PALADINS]. Role: The rogue's role in a group can vary dramatically based on his skill selection, but most rogues share certain aspects. They aren't capable of prolonged melee combat, so they focus on opportunistic sneak attacks or ranged attacks. The rogue's stealth and trapfinding ability make him one of the best scouts in the game. Abilities: ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] provides extra protection for the lightly armored rogue.~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE], and ~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM] are important for many of the rogue's skills. A high Intelligence score also gives the rogue extra skill points, which can be used to expand her repertoire. Hit Die: d8Class ~Skills~[TAG_SKILLS]: ~Appraise~[TAG_APPRAISE], ~Bluff~[TAG_BLUFF], ~Diplomacy~[TAG_DIPLOMACY], ~Disable Device~[TAG_DISABLE_DEVICE], ~Gather Information~[TAG_GATHER_INFORMATION], ~Hide~[TAG_HIDE], ~Intimidate~[TAG_INTIMIDATE], ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN], ~Move Silently~[TAG_MOVE_SILENTLY], ~Open Lock~[TAG_OPEN_LOCK], ~Perform~[TAG_PERFORM], ~Search~[TAG_SEARCH], ~Sense Motive~[TAG_SENSE_MOTIVE], ~Sleight of Hand~[TAG_SLEIGHT], ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT], ~Tumble~[TAG_TUMBLE], and ~Use Magic Device~[TAG_UMD].Skill Points at 1st Level: (8 + Int modifier) X 4Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 8 + Int modifierClass Features:[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_SORCERERS	TAG_CLASSES			Sorcerers	Sorcerers create magic the way a poet creates poems, with inborn talent honed by practice. They have no books, no theories, no mentors--just raw power that they direct at will. Some sorcerers claim that the blood of dragons courses through their veins. This claim may be true in some cases, although many hold that the claim is either an unsubstantiated boast or envious gossip.Characteristics: Sorcerers cast spells through innate power rather than through careful training and study. Their magic is intuitive rather than logical. They can cast spells more often than wizards and have no need to select and prepare their spells ahead of time. Alignment: Any. Sorcery favors the free, chaotic, creative spirit over the disciplined mind, so sorcerers tend slightly towards chaos over law. Otherwise, sorcerer alignment varies considerably. Other Classes: Sorcerers find that they have the most in common with members of other largely self-taught classes, such as ~druids~[TAG_DRUIDS] and ~rogues~[TAG_ROGUES]. They sometimes find themselves at odds with members of the more disciplined classes, such as ~paladins~[TAG_PALADINS] and ~monks~[TAG_MONKS]. Since they cast the same spells as ~wizards~[TAG_WIZARDS] do but do so in a different way, they sometimes find themselves in competition with wizards. Roles: A sorcerer tends to define her role based on spell selection. A sorcerer who focuses on damage-dealing spells becomes the center of the party's offensive power, while another sorcerer that relies on charms or illusions will take a quieter role. A party with a sorcerer should strongly consider a second spellcaster to make up for the sorcerer's lack of versatility. Since sorcerers rely on their charismatic presence when interacting with others, they often serve as the "face" for an adventuring party.Abilities: ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA] determines how powerful a spell a sorcerer can cast, how many spells he can cast per day, and how hard those spells are to resist. Like a wizard, a sorcerer benefits from high ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] and ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION] scores.Hit Die: d4Class ~Skills~[TAG_SKILLS]: ~Bluff~[TAG_BLUFF], ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION], and ~Spellcraft~[TAG_SPELLCRAFT].Skill Points at 1st Level: (2 + Int modifier) X 4Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modifierClass Features:[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_WIZARDS	TAG_CLASSES			Wizards	A few unintelligible words and fleeting gestures carry more power than a battleaxe, when they are the words and gestures of a wizard. These simple acts make magic seem easy, but they only hint at the time the wizard must spend poring over her spellbook preparing each spell for casting, and the years before that spent in apprenticeship to learn the arts of magic. For wizards, magic is not a talent but a difficult, rewarding art.Characteristics: The wizard's strength is his spells. Everything else is secondary. He learns new spells as he explores and grows in experience.   Some wizards prefer to specialize in a certain type of magic. ~Specialization~[TAG_CHARGEN_WIZARD_SPECIALIZATION] makes a wizard more powerful in his chosen field, but it denies him access to some of the spells that lie outside that field.  Like a ~sorcerer~[TAG_SORCERERS], a wizard can call a familiar-a small, magical animal companion that serves him.Alignment: Any. Overall, wizards show a slight tendency toward law over chaos because the study of magic rewards those who are disciplined. Illusionists and transmuters, however, are masters of deception and change, respectively. They favor chaos over law. Other Classes: Wizards prefer to work with members of other classes. They love to cast their spells from behind strong ~fighters~[TAG_FIGHTERS], to "magic up" ~rogues~[TAG_ROGUES] and send them out to scout, and to rely on the divine healing of ~clerics~[TAG_CLERICS]. They may find members of certain classes (such as sorcerers, rogues, and ~bards~[TAG_BARDS]) to be not quite serious enough, but they're not judgmental. Role: The wizard's role depends somewhat on his spell selection, but most wizards share certain similarities in function. They are among the most offensively minded of the spellcasting classes, with a broad range of options available for neutralizing enemies. Abilities: ~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE] determines how powerful a spell a wizard can cast, how many spells she can cast per day, and how hard those spells are to resist. A high ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] score is helpful for a wizard, who typically wears little or no armor, because it provides her with a bonus to ~Armor Class~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS]. A good ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION] score gives a wizard extra ~hit points~[TAG_HIT_POINTS], a resource she is otherwise very low on.Hit Die: d4Class ~Skills~[TAG_SKILLS]: ~Bluff~[TAG_BLUFF], ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION], and ~Spellcraft~[TAG_SPELLCRAFT].Skill Points at 1st Level: (2 + Int modifier) X 4Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modifierClass Features:[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_EXPERIENCE_AND_LEVELS	TAG_CLASSES			Experience and Levels	Experience points (XP) measure how much your character has learned and how much he or she has grown in personal power. Your character earns XP by defeating monsters and completing quests. When your character's XP total reaches at least the minimum XP needed for a new character level (see the chart on the ~Class Benefits~[TAG_CLASS_BENEFITS]), he or she "goes up a level." Characters can only go up one level at a time.Below are the point totals needed to attain a given character level--that is, the total of all the characer's levels in classes:1st       @t02nd     @t1,0003rd      @t3,0004th      @t6,0005th     @t10,0006th     @t15,0007th     @t21,0008th     @t28,0009th     @t36,00010th       @t45,000
TAG_MULTICLASS	TAG_CLASSES			Multiclass Characters	When a character advances a level, he or she may choose to advance in a different class than the original class selected. Once a character has two or more different classes, that character is said to be a multiclass character.Characters gain ~abilities~[TAG_ABILITIES] and ~features~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_DESC] according to their new class, but their overall level remains the combined total of all their levels. Thus, a 7th level cleric/1st level barbarian is said to be an 8th level character.A multiclass character receives a 20% experience point reduction penalty for each class that is not within 2 levels of his highest class. Note that a character's favored class (dependent upon ~race~[TAG_RACES]) does not count as the highest level.
TAG_SKILLS				Skills	A character's skills represent a variety of abilities. As a character advances in level, he or she gets better at using some or all of her skills.[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_FEATS				Feats	A feat is a special feature that either gives your character a new capability or improves one that he or she already has. Unlike skills, feats have no ranks. A character either has a feat or he does not.[CMD_CHILDREN_SORTED]
TAG_DESCRIPTION				Character Description	The following are ways that you can customize your characters within the game:~Character Generation~[TAG_CHARGEN][CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_EQUIPMENT				Equipment	Your characters begin with a small amount of gold to purchase equipment before entering the game. You will be allowed to select from a list of available items and keep the remaining money.[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_COMBAT				Combat	Combat takes place in rounds. If some of the combatants are unaware that hostilities have begun, those who are aware act in a ~surprise round~[TAG_SURPRISE] before the others. Combatants who have not had an action yet in combat are ~flat-footed~[TAG_FLAT_FOOTED].Participants in combat first roll for ~initiative~[TAG_INITIATIVE]. The highest result will have the first action, and the other participants will follow in order, from highest to lowest. Ties are broken by comparing ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] scores. The highter Dexterity will go before the lower one in a tie.The computer will handle all these rolls for you before combat begins by placing the combatants in order of initiative across the top of your screen.In a normal round, your character can perform a ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION] and a ~move action~[TAG_MOVEMENT_ACTION], or a ~full-round action~[TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION]. He or she can always substitute a move action for a standard action. ~Free actions~[TAG_FREE_ACTION] do not count toward either limitation. In the 3.5 edition of Temple of Elemental Evil, actions are categorized as ~Full~[TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION], ~Standard~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION], ~Move~[TAG_MOVEMENT_ACTION], and ~Free~[TAG_FREE_ACTION].  You can perform as many Free actions in a round as you wish.  In a single round, you can perform:-a Full action-a Standard action and a Move action -two Move actionsLikewise, if you haven't physically moved in a round, you can perform a ~five foot step~[TAG_5_FOOT_STEP].  This is an example of an action that does not fit neatly into any category; the five foot step and other such examples that are more difficult to classify are known as ~miscellaneous actions~[TAG_MISC_ACTION].In addition to the ~standard combat actions~[TAG_COMBAT_ACTIONS], there are ~special attacks~[TAG_SPECIAL_ATTACKS] and ~special initiative actions~[TAG_SPECIAL_INIT] that can be done.Specifically, in ToEE, there are several combat options that are available through the use of the ~radial menu~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU], including the following:~AutoEnd Turn~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_AUTOEND_TURN]~Deal Nonlethal Damage~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_NONLETHAL_DAMAGE]~Cast Defensively~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_CAST_DEFENSIVELY]For further descriptions of actual combat within ToEE, please see ~Combat and Game Play~[TAG_COMBAT_AND_GAME_PLAY]. 
TAG_ADVENTURING				Adventuring	  Carrying Capacity: Each item in your character's inventory or equipment has an associated weight to it. The carrying capacity of your character is based on the character's ~strength~[TAG_STRENGTH], modified by 3/4 if the character is a ~gnome~[TAG_GNOMES] or ~halfling~[TAG_HALFLINGS].  Characters suffer penalties if carrying Medium or Heavy loads. These penalties include:1. Limitations to the character's ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] bonus because of ~Encumbrance~[TAG_ADVENTURING_ENCUMBRANCE]2. A check penalty on some skills3. Reduction in the character's speed4. Reduction in the distance a character can run in a round  Movement: Characters can move at the rate of a ~move~[TAG_ADVENTURING_MOVE], ~double move~[TAG_ADVENTURING_DOUBLE_MOVE], or ~run~[TAG_RUN].   Exploration: All characters have a vision range dependant upon their character's ~class~[TAG_CLASSES]. In the game, this is represented by the fog, which hides any creature(s) outside of the sight range. Characters should be put into a Marching Order or Formation, through the use of the ~in-game interface~[TAG_INGAME].  Treasure and Other Rewards: Treasure is generally split up evenly between party members, and player characters can transfer items freely between themselves. However, some NPC's in the game require more or less treasure, or perhaps just particular items. Additionally, your character's actions are monitored in the game, and the party may pick up a reputation, which can be good or bad depending on the circumstances. Being coined the Butcher of Hommlet certainly wouldn't win you any friends in Hommlet, but might earn you some respect in the Temple.
TAG_MAGIC				Magic	Casting Spells: Your spellcaster will be able to cast spells through the use of the ~radial menu~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU] in the game. By selecting the class and level of the spell, the spellcaster's available spells will be shown and available for casting. Casting in combat usually requires a ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION], although some require a ~full-round action~[TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION]. In ToEE, a full round spell occurs instantaneously and then the caster gets no further action. ~Sorcerers~[TAG_SORCERERS] or ~bards~[TAG_BARDS] who are casting a metamagic version of a spell must take more time to do so.  If a spell's normal casting time is 1 standard action, then casting a metamagic version of the spell is a full-round action for a sorcerer or bard.  For ~Clerics~[TAG_CLERICS], spontaneously casting a metamagic version of a spell with a casting time of 1 standard action is also a full-round action.While casting in combat usually is a standard action, the occasional spell may require a casting time referred to as ~Out of Combat~[TAG_OUT_OF_COMBAT].Sometimes distractions (often through ~combat~[TAG_COMBAT]) require a spellcaster to make a ~concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION] check to see if the spell is successful. Spell failure results in the loss of that spell.The majority of spells belong to one of ~eight schools of magic~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS].Spells belong to one of two types:~Arcane Spells~[TAG_ARCANE_SPELLS]~Divine Spells~[TAG_DIVINE_SPELLS]Some magical creatures can create magical effects without being spellcasters, and certain ~magic items~[TAG_MAGIC_ITEMS] create magical effects. These effects come in two types: spell-like and supernatural. Additionally, members of certain classes and certain creatures can use speical abilities that aren't magical. These abilities are called either extraordinary or natural.

TAG_INTERFACE_HELP				Interface Help (General Interfaces)	[CMD_CHILDREN]Note that during game play you can access the ~Main Menu~[TAG_MAIN_MENU] at any time by pressing the ESC key, which will allow you to ~Load and Save games~[TAG_LOADSAVE] as well as Quit the game altogether.
TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS				Character Conditions	[CMD_CHILDREN_SORTED]
TAG_ABILITY_DAMAGED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Ability Damaged	The character has temporarily lost 1 or more ~ability~[TAG_THE_ABILITIES] score points.  Lost points return at a rate of 1 per day unless noted otherwise by the condition dealing the damage.  A character with Strength 0, Dexterity 0, Intelligence 0, Wisdom 0, or Charisma 0 is ~paralyzed~[TAG_PARALYZED].  A character with Constitution 0 is dead.  Ability damage is different from penalties to ability scores, which go away when the conditions causing them (fatigue, entanglement, etc.) go away.
TAG_ABILITY_DRAINED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Ability Drained	The character has permanently lost 1 or more ~ability~[TAG_THE_ABILITIES] score points.  The character can only regain these points through magical means. A character with Strength 0, Dexterity 0, Intelligence 0, Wisdom 0, or Charisma 0 is ~paralyzed~[TAG_PARALYZED]. A character with Constitution 0 is dead.  
TAG_BLINDED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Blinded	The character cannot see.  He takes a -2 penalty to AC, loses his ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] bonus to AC (if any), moves at half speed, and takes a -4 penalty on ~Search~[TAG_SEARCH] checks and on most ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH]- and Dexterity-based skill checks.  All checks and activities that rely on vision (such as reading and ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT] checks) automatically fail.  All opponents are considered to have total concealment (50% miss chance) to the blinded character.     Characters who remain blinded for a long time grow accustomed to these drawbacks and can overcome some of them.
TAG_CONFUSED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Confused	A confused character's actions are determined by rolling d% at the beginning of his turn.  A confused character who can't carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently.  Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking a confused character.  Any confused character who is attacked automatically attacks her attackers on her next turn, as long as she is still confused when her turn comes.  A confused character does not make ~attacks of opportunity~[TAG_AOO] against any creature that she is not already devoted to attacking (either because of her most recent action or because she has just been attacked).
TAG_COWERING	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Cowering	The character is frozen in fear and can take no actions.  A cowering character takes a -2 penalty to AC and loses his ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] bonus (if any).
TAG_DAZED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Dazed	The creature is unable to act normally.  A dazed creature can take no actions, but has no penalty to AC.
TAG_DEAD	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS	TAG_DAZZLED		Dead	The character's hit points are reduced to -10, his ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION] drops to 0, or he is killed outright by a spell or effect.  The character's soul leaves his body.  Dead characters cannot benefit from normal or magical healing, but they can be restored to life via magic.  
TAG_DEAFENED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Deafened	A deafened character cannot hear.  She takes a -4 penalty on initiative checks, automatically fails ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN] checks, and has a 20% chance of spell failure when casting spells with verbal components.     Characters who remain deafened grow accustomed to these drawbacks and can overcome some of them.
TAG_DISABLED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Disabled	A character with 0 hit points, or one who has negative hit points but has become stable and conscious, is disabled.  A disabled character may take a single ~move action~[TAG_MOVEMENT_ACTION] or ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION] each round (but not both, nor can she take ~full-round actions~[TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION]).  She moves at half speed.  Taking move actions doesn't risk further injury, but performing any standard action deals 1 point of damage after the completion of the act.  Unless the action increased the disabled character's hit points, she is now in negative hit points and dying.     A disabled character recovers hit points from resting normally.        
TAG_DYING	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Dying	A dying character is unconscious and near death.  She has -1 to -9 current hit points.  A dying character can take no actions and is unconscious.  At the end of each round (starting with the round in which the character dropped below 0 hit points), the character rolls d% to see whether she becomes stable.  She has a 10% chance of becoming stable.  If she does not, she loses 1 hit point.  If a dying character reaches -10 hit points, she is dead.
TAG_ENERGY_DRAINED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Energy Drained	The character gains one or more negative levels, which might permanently drain the character's levels.     If the subject has at least as many negative levels as Hit Dice, he dies.  Each negative level gives a creature the following penalties: -1 penalty on attack rolls, ~saving throws~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC], ~skill~[TAG_SKILLS] checks, ~ability~[TAG_ABILITIES] checks, loss of 5 hit points, and -1 to effective level (for determining the power, duration, DC, and other details of spells or special abilities).  In addition, a spellcaster loses one spell or spell slot from the highest spell level castable.
TAG_ENTANGLED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Entangled	The character is ensnared.  Being entangled impedes movement, but does not entirely prevent it unless the bonds are anchored to an immobile object or tethered by an opposing force.  An entangled creature moves at half speed, cannot run or charge, and takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls and a -4 penalty to ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY].  An entangled character who attempts to cast a spell must make a ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION] check (DC 15 + the spell's level) or lose the spell.
TAG_EXHAUSTED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Exhausted	An exhausted character moves at half speed and take a -6 penalty to ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] and ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY].  After 1 hour of complete rest, an exhausted character becomes ~fatigued~[TAG_FATIGUED].  A fatigued character becomes exhausted by doing something else that would normally cause fatigue.
TAG_FATIGUED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS	TAG_FASCINATED		Fatigued	A fatigued character can neither run nor charge and takes a -2 penalty to ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] and ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY].  Doing anything that would normally cause fatigue causes the fatigued character to become exhausted.  After 8 hours of complete rest, fatigued characters are no longer fatigued.
TAG_GRAPPLING	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Grappling	Engaged in wrestling or some other form of hand-to-hand struggle with one or more attackers.  A grappling character can undertake only a limited number of actions.  He does not threaten any squares, and loses his ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] bonus to AC (if any) against opponents he isn't grappling.
TAG_HELD	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Held	Held characters are subject to enchantments that make them unable to move.  They are helpless.  They can perform no physical actions (but they continue to breathe and can take purely mental actions).
TAG_INVISIBLE	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Invisible	Visually undetectable.  An invisible creature gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls against sighted opponents, and ignores its opponents' ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] bonuses to AC (if any).Invisible creatures also gain the 50% automatic miss chance afforded by ~total concealment~[TAG_CONCEALMENT].
TAG_NAUSEATED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS	TAG_LEVEL_LOSS		Nauseated	Experiencing stomach distress.  Nauseated creatures are unable to attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, or do anything else requiring attention.  The only action such a character can take is a single ~move action~[TAG_MOVEMENT_ACTION] per turn.
TAG_PARALYZED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Paralyzed	A Paralyzed character stands rigid, unable to move or act physically.  He has effective ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] and ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] scores of 0 and is helpless, but can take purely mental actions.  
TAG_PRONE	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Prone	The character is on the ground.  An attacker who is prone has a -4 penalty on ~melee attack~[TAG_MELEE_ATTACKS] rolls and cannot use a ranged weapon (except for a crossbow).  A defender who is prone gains a +4 bonus to AC against ranged attacks, but takes a -4 penalty to AC against melee attacks.  
TAG_STAGGERED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS	TAG_SICKENED		Staggered	A character whose nonlethal damage exactly equals his current hit points is staggered.  A staggered character may take a single ~move action~[TAG_MOVEMENT_ACTION] or ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION] each round (but not both, nor can he take ~full-round actions~[TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION]).
TAG_STUNNED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Stunned	A stunned creature can't take actions, takes a -2 penalty to AC, and loses his ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] bonus to AC (if any).
TAG_TURNED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Turned	Affected by a turn undead attempt.  Turned undead flee for 10 rounds (1 minute) by the best and fastest means available to them.  If they cannot flee, they cower.
TAG_UNCONSCIOUS	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Unconscious	Knocked out and helpless.  Unconsciousness can result from having current hit points between -1 and -9, or from nonlethal damage in excess of current hit points.
TAG_MAIN_MENU	TAG_INTERFACE_HELP			Main Menu	The Main Menu is the first selection screen that appears when you start the game. Additionally, you can back out to this menu by quitting the game, or you can bring it up by pressing the ESC key from within the game.From the main menu, you will be able to start a new ~Normal Game~[TAG_NORMAL_GAME], a new ~Ironman Game~[TAG_IRONMAN], ~Load or Save a game~[TAG_LOADSAVE] or Quit the game altogether.
TAG_LOADSAVE	TAG_INTERFACE_HELP			Loading and Saving Games	From within the game, you can bring up the ~Main Menu~[TAG_MAIN_MENU] by pressing the ESC key. From the Main Menu, you can select to Save your game in progress or Load an existing game (and thus leave your current game). In the Save Game menu, you can choose an empty slot or delete a previously saved game by saving over it. You can then name your saved game.From the Load Game menu, simply click on the game you would like to load, highlighting it, and then ACCEPT it to load the game. Remember that this will destroy any game in progress.Finally, you can use the F12 key to do a Quick Save of the game at any time or the F9 key to do a Quick Load of the last Quick Save game.
TAG_IRONMAN	TAG_INTERFACE_HELP			Ironman Mode	Ironman Mode is a special mode of the game where you are not allowed to ~Load and Save games~[TAG_LOADSAVE], although you may Quick Save and Exit and Quick Load to return to the game. You are also not allowed to reroll your characters once you have selected them.
TAG_CHARGEN	TAG_INTERFACE_HELP			Character Generation 	Once you have selected a party ~alignment~[TAG_ALIGNMENT], you may begin character generation by selecting the blue character boxes at the bottom of the screen.First you roll for your ~ability~[TAG_ABILITIES] scores. If you don't like the outcome, you can reroll your scores. Once you find scores to your liking, you then click and drag them to the ability of your choice. Modifiers are shown as soon as you place the score.When done, you then select your ~Race~[TAG_RACES], ~Gender~[TAG_CHARGEN_GENDER], ~Height~[TAG_CHARGEN_HEIGHT], ~Hairstyle~[TAG_CHARGEN_HAIR], ~Class~[TAG_CLASSES], ~Alignment~[TAG_CHARGEN_ALIGNMENT], and ~Deity~[TAG_CHARGEN_DEITY], as well as a portrait, voice, and name for your character.You also select your class abilities (where applicable) ~feats~[TAG_FEATS], ~skills~[TAG_SKILLS], and ~spells~[TAG_SPELLS] (if any) from the lists with available ones highlighted in white and class specific ones displayed in yellow. You must select all your skills, feats, and spells before moving on to the next category.After naming your character (the last step), you can then select FINISH and your character will be ready to begin adventuring.For more detailed information about each interface within Character Generation, please see ~Interface Help (Specific)~[TAG_HMU_ROOT], and scroll down to the PC Creation section.
TAG_INGAME	TAG_INTERFACE_HELP			In-Game Interface	You can press ESC at any time to bring up the Main Menu from within the game in order to load, save, or exit the game. Addtionally, at the bottom right of the game screen, you can select party formations, your logbook, the town map, this help text, or game options.You can select characters by clicking on them. For multiple characters, you can SHIFT-click on them or rope them together by clicking and dragging the mouse around the characters you want to select.You can give your characters commands through the ~radial menu~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU] by right clicking on a character.To move selected characters, left click on the destination where you would like them to move.You can left click on NPCs to interact with them. If they are not hostile, it will open a dialog with them. If they are hostile, combat will begin.
TAG_ACQUIRE_SKILLS	TAG_SKILLS			Acquiring Skill Ranks	Characters begin with a certain number of skill points to assign to various skills. Depending on the class, this is 2, 4, 6, or 8 + the ~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE] modifier, and then multiplied by 4. ~Humans~[TAG_HUMANS] gain an extra 4 skill points.~Clerics~[TAG_CLERICS], ~Fighters~[TAG_FIGHTERS], ~Paladins~[TAG_PALADINS], ~Sorcerers~[TAG_SORCERERS], and ~Wizards~[TAG_WIZARDS]:(2 + Int modifier) X 4~Barbarians~[TAG_BARBARIANS], ~Druids~[TAG_DRUIDS], and ~Monks~[TAG_MONKS]:(4 + Int modifier) X 4~Bard~[TAG_BARDS] and ~Ranger~[TAG_RANGERS]:(6 + Int modifer) X 4~Rogue~[TAG_ROGUES]:(8 + Int modifer) X 4After first level, skill points are assigned at the same rates above, but without the X 4 multiplier. Thus a 2nd level bard gains 6 + Int modifer new skill points. Humans gain one extra skill point each level as well.To spend skill points to buy skill ranks, one skill point can be spent for each class skill. If a character wants to buy a non-class skill rank, he or she must spend 2 skill points to gain one rank, or one skill point to gain a half rank. A character may never buy more than their level + 3 skill ranks in any one class skill. So a 4th level rogue cannot buy skill ranks above level 7 for class skills. For non-class skills, this maximum number is halved. So the same level 4 rogue could not buy ranks above 3.5 in any non-class skill.
TAG_USING_SKILLS	TAG_SKILLS			Using Skills	Skills are used by performing skill checks.To make a skill check, roll:1d20 + skill modifier(skill modifier = skill rank + ability modifier + miscellaneous modifers)Each skill has a key ability associated with it, which affects the ability modifier above. Miscellaneous modifiers include racial bonuses, armor check penalties, and bonuses provided by feats, among others.Some checks are made against a DC (difficulty class). This number is assigned according to the situation, and then the skill check is made against it. If the skill check roll matches or exceeds the DC, the skill has been performed successfully.Usually a character can try again on a fail, although time may pass. If failure would result in danger, then trying again may not be possible.Characters may perform untrained skill checks against their key ability modifiers. 
TAG_SKILL_DES	TAG_SKILLS			Skill Descriptions	[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_APPRAISE	TAG_SKILL_DES			Appraise	Use this skill to tell an antique from junk, an old, fancy sword from an elven heirloom, and high-quality jewelry from cheap imitations.  In the game, the displayed values for items that appear in the bartering interfaces will be modified depending upon your level of expertise (or rank) in Appraise.  Therefore, you will be able to purchase items for less money, and in turn sell items for more profit, if you have a higher Appraise skill. The key ability for Appraise is ~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE].
TAG_BLUFF 	TAG_SKILL_DES			Bluff	You can make the outrageous or the untrue seem plausible.  The skill encompasses acting, conning, fast talking, misdirection, and misleading body language.  A ~Sense Motive~[TAG_SENSE_MOTIVE] check allows an NPC to determine if you are bluffing.  Bluff can also be used to ~feint~[TAG_FEINT] an opponent in combat.  In the game, the success or failure of an attempted bluff is determined by your skill level.  Within the dialogue, some lines will have a DC that your skill level must equal or exceed in order to be successful.   In the event that your skill level does beat the DC, a line of dialogue will appear with an icon, acknowledging your superior ability in that skill.  Selecting the line will draw you into an appropriate course of conversation for your actions.The key ability for Bluff is ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA].
TAG_CONCENTRATION	TAG_SKILL_DES			Concentration	You are particularly good at focusing your mind.  As a spellcaster, you must make a concentration check whenever you take damage while casting a spell, to determine whether or not the spell is disrupted.  A spellcaster may be vulnerable to damage while casting a spell or while readying an action through ~attacks of opportunity~[TAG_AOO] .  The higher your skill level in concentration, the more likely that you will be successful in casting a spell, even under duress.  The key ability for Concentration is ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION].
TAG_DIPLOMACY	TAG_SKILL_DES			Diplomacy	Diplomacy is a skill that can be used when speaking with NPCs. It encompasses etiquette, social grace, tact, and a way with words.  This skill represents the ability to give others the right impression of yourself.    Like other dialogue skills, your true success regarding Diplomacy in the game is dependent upon your skill level.  Within the dialogue, some lines will have a DC that your skill level must equal or exceed in order to be successful.   In the event that your skill level does beat the DC, a line of dialogue will appear with an icon, acknowledging your superior ability in that skill.  Selecting the line will draw you into an appropriate course of conversation for your actions. The key ability for Diplomacy is ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA].
TAG_DISABLE_DEVICE	TAG_SKILL_DES			Disable Device	Use this skill to attempt to disarm a trap on a chest or door.  The Disable Device skill check determines if your skill level is higher or lower than the DC of the trap that you are trying to disable.  If this skill check succeeds, the trap is deactivated.  A character must be aware of a trap in order to disable it.  If the Disable Device skill check fails by 4 or more, the trap will be triggered.  Otherwise, the skill check may be used indefinitely.  ~Rogues~[TAG_ROGUES] (and other characters with the trapfinding class feature) can disarm magical traps against a DC of 25 + the spell level of the magic used to create it. The key ability for Disable Device is ~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE], though it can only be used if one has been trained in it.
TAG_GATHER_INFORMATION	TAG_SKILL_DES			Gather Information	Gather Information is the key ability used to garner rumors, find out local gossip, and collect general knowledge from others throughout the game. It can be used in conversations with NPCs to open up new avenues of dialogue.  In ToEE, the quality of information and rumors that you obtain from others is directly related to your skill level in Gather Information.  The higher your skill level, the juicier the rumor or the more interesting and helpful the information will be.  Regardless of skill level, you will be asked to pay a standard fee for any information you accumulate.     The game has several different story-states, and in each story there are different levels of success in gathering information.  If you return to a story in which you have previously had little success, after bumping up your skill level you might find the situation to be much improved.  There are many avenues of dialogue that Gather Information can open for your character.  The key ability for Gather Information is ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA].
TAG_HEAL	TAG_SKILL_DES			Heal	Use this skill to keep a badly wounded friend from dying. Heal can only be used on a dying creature.  If a character has negative hit points and is losing hit points (at the rate of 1 per round, 1 per hour, or 1 per day), you can make him or her stable.  A character can be healed if the Heal check succeeds against a DC of 15.  A stable character is unable to regain hit points but will no longer lose any hit points.  The key ability for Heal is ~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM].
TAG_HIDE	TAG_SKILL_DES			Hide	Use this skill to sink back into the shadows and proceed unseen.A hostile character may not detect you if you have hidden well.  As a player, you can use Hide (and ~Move Silently~[TAG_MOVE_SILENTLY] as well) for being in "sneak" mode.  A successful attempt at using Hide is opposed by the ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT] check of anyone who might be able to see you.  The key ability for Hide is ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY].  Armor check penalties apply.
TAG_INTIMIDATE	TAG_SKILL_DES			Intimidate	Intimidate is another skill that can be used to open up new avenues of dialog with NPCs, although they may not warm to you in the same manner.  You may use this skill to get a bully to back down, to frighten an opponent, or to get information by forceful means.    In the game, some lines of dialogue will have a DC that your skill level must equal or exceed in order to be successful.   In the event that your skill level does beat the DC, a line of dialogue will appear with an icon, acknowledging your superior ability in that skill.  Selecting the line will draw you into an appropriate course of conversation for your actions.The key ability for Intimidate is ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA].
TAG_LISTEN	TAG_SKILL_DES			Listen	Use a listen check to try to hear enemies approaching or to listen through a door to an adjacent room. It can alert you to the presence of enemies, taking away ~surprise rounds~[TAG_SURPRISE] (for example, the enemy could surprise you, but you make the listen check and manage to avoid a surprise round) and possibly even give you a surprise round (in turn, you are able to surprise the enemy).  Listen is used as the opposing check for ~Move Silently~[TAG_MOVE_SILENTLY], enabling you to hear a person while they are in "sneak" mode (which Move Silently is a part of).The key ability for Listen is ~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM].
TAG_MOVE_SILENTLY	TAG_SKILL_DES			Move Silently	As with Hide, you use this skill to remain undetected by an enemy while moving. If you are unsuccessful at making your skill check against an opposing ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN] check, you will be heard and the enemy will see you.  Move Silently is used as part of being in "sneak" mode, and its skill bonuses apply only when sneaking.The key ability for Move Silently is ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY].  Armor check penalties apply.
TAG_OPEN_LOCK	TAG_SKILL_DES			Open Lock	You can pick all kinds of locks with this skill.  Your skills in using Open Lock are pitted against the DC of the lock (or the lock's difficulty).  If successful, the lock is picked (and will never again be locked).  This skill check can be used indefinitely.Its key ability is ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY], though it can only be used if one has been trained in it.
TAG_PERFORM	TAG_SKILL_DES			Perform	Perform is used SOLELY for the purpose of increasing one's ~bardic music~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_BARDIC_MUSIC] abilities.  This skill is not recommended for use by any class other than the ~bard~[TAG_BARDS].Its key ability is ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA].
TAG_SEARCH	TAG_SKILL_DES			Search	You can find secret doors and simple traps by searching. Search does not allow a character to find complex traps unless she is a ~rogue~[TAG_ROGUES]. Search lets characters discern some small details or irregularities through active effort, while ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT] lets the character notice something, such as a hiding rogue.  A concentrated Search skill check is available via the radial menu, using the Skills icon. This skill allows a player to search for traps.  This skill check will result in an automatic 20 ("take 20"), including help from any party members who can successfully complete a skill check of DC 10 (rolled automatically in the game).  Those party members who were successful in making the Search check would help through gaining a +2 bonus.  Only rogues can find magical traps (DC 20+).  There is also a passive search conducted when "using" any container or portal that contains an unnoticed trap.  This passive search will stop the "use" if it successfully finds a trap.  If unsuccessful, the trap will go off.  This skill check can be retried indefinitely.Its key ability is ~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE].
TAG_SENSE_MOTIVE	TAG_SKILL_DES			Sense Motive	Sense Motive is a dialogue skill that enables your character tell if an NPC is lying to your party.  It is generally performed against the NPC's ~Bluff~[TAG_BLUFF] skill.    Within the dialogue, some lines will have a DC that your Sense Motive skill level must equal or exceed in order to be successful.   In the event that your skill level does beat the DC, a line of dialogue will appear with an icon, acknowledging your superior ability in that skill.  For Sense Motive, if the line even appears at all, you automatically recognize that the NPC is lying.  If you choose to select that line and begin a dialogue exchange, this selection means that you call the NPC on his or her bluff attempt.Its key ability is ~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM].
TAG_SLEIGHT	TAG_SKILL_DES			Sleight of Hand	You can palm a tiny or small object.  This skill is used for the basic purposes of pick pocketing.  When you use this skill under close observation, your skill check is opposed by the observer's ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT] check.  The observer's success doesn't prevent you from performing the action, just from doing it unnoticed.  If you try to take something from another creature, you must make a DC 20 Sleight of Hand check to obtain it.  The opponent makes a Spot check to detect the attempt, opposed by the same Sleight of Hand check result you achieved when you tried to grab the item.Its key ability is ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY], though it can only be used if trained.  Armor check penalties also apply.
TAG_SPELLCRAFT	TAG_SKILL_DES			Spellcraft	This skill enables a spellcaster to recognize a spell cast by an enemy spellcaster.  It is used by ~wizards~[TAG_WIZARDS] to copy a scroll into their spellbook.  Spellcraft will also allow you to automatically counterspell a specific spell that is known.Its key ability is ~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE], and it can only be used if trained.
TAG_SPOT	TAG_SKILL_DES			Spot	Use this skill to spot unnnoticed creatures.  Spot is used solely as an opposing check against ~Hide~[TAG_HIDE] and is rolled automatically within the game to determine success or failure.  Its key ability is ~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM].
TAG_SURVIVAL	TAG_SKILL_DES			Survival	You are able to avoid random encounters while traveling on the world map, if your survival skill is high enough.  You will have the choice of whether to avoid them or go ahead with them depending on what you detect with your skill.  For example, if the player's skill rank equals or exceeds the CR (challenge rating), they are shown an interface which presents the creatures involved in the random encounter.  The player is given the choice to enter the encounter or skip it entirely.  If the skill rank is less then the CR of the encounter, the player is not shown the interface and the encounter begins.Its key ability is ~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM].

However, the invisible attacker's bonuses do still apply for ranged attacks.     You take only half the usual penalty to speed for being unable to see.  Darkness and poor visibility in general reduce your speed to three-quarters of what it would normally be, instead of one-half.     Normal: For invisible attackers trying to hit you, regular attack roll modifiers apply, and you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC.  Speed reduction for darkness and poor visibility also applies.     Special: The Blind-Fight feat is of no use against a character who is the subject of a ~Blink~[TAG_SPELLS_BLINK] spell.       A fighter may select Blind-Fight as one of his bonus feats.

Whoever drinks the potion is the target of the spell.    The base price of a potion is its spell level x its caster level x 50gp.  To brew a potion, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one half this base price.  Any potion that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost.

TAG_CLEAVE	TAG_FEATS_DES			Cleave	You can follow through with powerful blows.     Prerequisite: ~Str~[TAG_STRENGTH] 13, ~Power Attack~[TAG_POWER_ATTACK].     Benefit: If you cause enough damage to a creature to make it drop below 0 hit points or kill it, you get an immediate, extra ~melee attack~[TAG_MELEE_ATTACKS] against another creature within reach.  You cannot take a 5-foot step before making this extra attack.  The extra attack is with the same weapon and at the same bonus as the attack that dropped the previous creature.  You can use this ability once per round.     A fighter may select Cleave as one of his fighter bonus feats.
TAG_COMBAT_CASTING	TAG_FEATS_DES			Combat Casting	You are adept at casting spells in combat.     Benefit: You get a +4 bonus on ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION] checks made to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability while on the defensive or while you are ~grappling~[TAG_GRAPPLING] or pinned.

This number may not exceed your base attack bonus.  The changes to attack rolls and AC last until your next action.       Normal: A character without the Combat Expertise feat can fight defensively while using the attack or full attack action to take a -4 penalty on attack rolls and gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC.     Special: A ~fighter~[TAG_FIGHTERS] may select Combat Expertise as one of his fighter bonus feats.
TAG_COMBAT_REFLEXES	TAG_FEATS_DES			Combat Reflexes	You can respond quickly and repeatedly to opponents who let their defenses down.     Benefit: When foes leave themselves open, you may make a number of additional ~attacks of opportunity~[TAG_AOO] equal to your ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] bonus.  For example, a ~fighter~[TAG_FIGHTERS] with a Dex of 15 can make a total of three attacks of opportunity in 1 round--the one attack of opportunity any character is entitled to, plus two more because of the fighter's +2 Dex bonus.  Likewise, if 4 goblins move out of the fighter's threatened squares, he can make an attack of opportunity against three of them.  You can still only make one attack of opportunity per actual opportunity.     With this feat, you may also make attacks of opportunity while ~flat-footed~[TAG_FLAT_FOOTED].     Normal: A character without this feat can make only one attack of opportunity per round and can't make attacks of opportunity while flat-footed.     Special: The Combat Reflexes feat does not allow a rogue to use her opportunist ability more than once per round.     A fighter may select Combat Reflexes as one of her fighter bonus feats.

To enchant a wondrous item, you must spend 1/25 of the item's price in XP and use up raw materials costing half of this price.     You can also mend a broken wondrous item if it is one that you could make.  Doing so costs half the XP, raw materials, and time that it would take to craft that item in the first place.       Some wondrous items incur extra costs in the material components or XP, as noted in their descriptions.  These costs are in addition to those derived from the item's base price.  You must pay such a cost to create an item or to mend a broken one.  
TAG_DEFLECT_ARROWS	TAG_FEATS_DES			Deflect Arrows	You can deflect incoming arrows, as well as bolts, spears, and other projectile or thrown weapons.     Prerequisite: ~Dex~[TAG_DEXTERITY] 13, ~Improved Unarmed Strike~[TAG_IMPROVED_UNARMED].     Benefit: You must have at least one hand free (holding nothing) to use this feat.

Unusual missiles, such as boulders hurled by giants and ranged attacks generated by spell effects, such as ~Melf's Acid Arrow~[TAG_SPELLS_MELF'S_ACID_ARROW], can't be deflected.     Special: A ~monk~[TAG_MONKS] may select Deflect Arrows as a bonus feat at 2nd level, even if she does not meet the prerequisites.     A fighter may select Deflect Arrows as one of his ~fighter~[TAG_FIGHTERS] bonus feats.

You can select a new opponent on any action.       A condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses.  Also, dodge bonuses (such as this one, or a dwarf's racial bonus on dodge attempts against giants) stack with each other, unlike most other bonuses.       Special: A ~fighter~[TAG_FIGHTERS] may select Dodge as one of her fighter bonus feats.
TAG_EMPOWER_SPELL	TAG_FEATS_DES			Empower Spell	You can cast spells to greater effect.     Benefit: All variable, numeric effects of an empowered spell are increased by one-half.

For example, an empowered ~Magic Missile~[TAG_SPELLS_MAGIC_MISSILE] deals 1 1/2 times its normal damage (roll 1d4+1 and multiply the result by 1 1/2 for each missile).  ~Saving throws~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] and opposed rolls (such as the one you make when you cast ~Dispel Magic~[TAG_SPELLS_DISPEL_MAGIC]) are not affected, nor are spells without random variables.  An empowered spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level.  
TAG_EXOTIC_PROF	TAG_FEATS_DES			Exotic Weapon Proficiency	Choose a type of exotic weapon, such as the ~bastard sword~[TAG_WEAPONS_SWORD_BASTARD] or ~shuriken~[TAG_WEAPONS_SHURIKEN].

Its effects stack.  Each time you take the feat, you can use each of your turning or rebuking abilities four additional times per day.

TAG_GREAT_FORT	TAG_FEATS_DES			Great Fortitude	You are tougher than normal.     Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on all ~Fortitude~[TAG_FORTITUDE] saving throws.
TAG_HEIGHTEN_SPELL	TAG_FEATS_DES			Heighten Spell	You can cast a spell as if it were a higher-level spell than it actually is.     Benefit: A heightened spell has a higher spell level than normal (up to a maximum of 9th level).  Unlike other metamagic feats, Heighten Spell actually increases the effective level of the spell that it modifies.  All effects dependent on spell level (such as ~saving throw~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] DCs and ability to penetrate a ~lesser globe of invulnerability~[TAG_SPELLS_LESSER_GLOBE_OF_INVULNERABILITY]) are calculated according to the heightened level.  The heightened  spell is as difficult to prepare and cast as a spell of its effective level.  For example, a ~cleric~[TAG_CLERICS] could prepare ~Hold Person~[TAG_SPELLS_HOLD_PERSON] as a 4th-level spell (instead of a 2nd-level spell), and it would in all ways be treated as 4th-level spell.
TAG_IMPROVED_CRITICAL	TAG_FEATS_DES			Improved Critical	Choose one type of weapon, such as a ~longsword~[TAG_WEAPONS_LONGSWORD] or ~greataxe~[TAG_WEAPONS_GREATAXE].

The effects do not stack.  Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of weapon.     This effect doesn't stack with any other effect that expands the threat range of a weapon (such as the ~Keen Edge~[TAG_SPELLS_KEEN_EDGE] spell).     A ~fighter~[TAG_FIGHTERS] may select Improved Critical as one of her fighter bonus feats.  
TAG_IMPROVED_INIT	TAG_FEATS_DES			Improved Initiative	You can react more quickly than normal in a fight.     Benefit: You get a +4 bonus on initiative checks.     Special: A ~fighter~[TAG_FIGHTERS] may select Improved Initiative as one of his fighter bonus feats.

However, you still get an attack of opportunity against any opponent who makes an unarmed attack on you.     Normal: Without this feat, you are considered unarmed when attacking with an unarmed strike, and you can deal only nonlethal damage with such an attack.     Special: A ~monk~[TAG_MONKS] automatically gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat at 1st.  She need not select it.     A ~fighter~[TAG_FIGHTERS] may select Improved Unarmed Strike as one of her fighter bonus feats. 
TAG_IRON_WILL	TAG_FEATS_DES			Iron Will	You have a stronger ~will~[TAG_WILL] than normal.     Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on all Will saving throws.

They need not select this feat.     You can gain Martial Weapon Proficiency multiple times.  Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of weapon.     A ~cleric~[TAG_CLERICS] who chooses the ~War domain~[TAG_WAR_D] automatically gains the Martial Weapon Proficiency feat related to his deity's favored weapon as a bonus feat, if the weapon is a martial one.  He need not select it.     
TAG_MAX_SPELL	TAG_FEATS_DES			Maximize Spell	You can cast spells to maximum effect.     Benefit: All variable, numeric effects of a spell modified by this feat are maximized.  A maximized spell deals maximum damage, cures the maximum number of hit points, affects the maximum number of targets, etc., as appropriate.  For example, a maximized ~fireball~[TAG_SPELLS_FIREBALL] deals 6 points of damage per caster level (up to a maximum of 60 points of damage at 10th caster level).  ~Saving throws~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] and opposed rolls (such as the one you make when you cast ~Dispel Magic~[TAG_SPELLS_DISPEL_MAGIC]) are not affected, nor are spells without random variables.  A maximized spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell's actual level.     An empowered, maximized spell gains the separate benefits of each feat: the maximum result plus one-half the normally rolled result.  An empowered, maximized fireball cast by a 10th-level wizard deals points of damage equal to 60 plus one-half of 10d6.

A condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses.  Dodge bonuses (such as this one and a dwarf's racial bonus on dodge attempts against giants) stack with each other, unlike most types of bonuses.     Special: A ~fighter~[TAG_FIGHTERS] may select Mobility as one of his fighter bonus feats.
TAG_POINT_BLANK	TAG_FEATS_DES			Point Blank Shot	You are skilled at making well-placed shots with ranged weapons at close range.     Benefit: You get a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with ranged weapons at ranges of up to 30 feet.     Special: A ~fighter~[TAG_FIGHTERS] may select Point Blank Shot as one of his fighter bonus feats.
TAG_POWER_ATTACK	TAG_FEATS_DES			Power Attack	You can make exceptionally powerful melee attacks.     Prerequisite: ~Str~[TAG_STRENGTH] 13.     Benefit: On your action, before making attack rolls for a round, you may choose to subtract a number from all ~melee attack~[TAG_MELEE_ATTACKS] rolls and add the same number to all melee damage rolls.  (If you attack with a two-handed weapon that isn't a double weapon, add twice this number instead).  This number may not exceed your base attack bonus.  The penalty on attacks and bonus on damage apply until your next turn.     You can't use Power Attack with a light weapon.     Special: A ~fighter~[TAG_FIGHTERS] may select Power Attack as one of her fighter bonus feats.

You can draw a hidden weapon as a move action.     A character who has selected this feat may throw weapons at her full normal rate of attacks (much like a character with a bow).     Normal: Without this feat, you may draw a weapon as a move action, or (if your base attack bonus is +1 or higher) as a free action as part of movement.  Without this feat, you can draw a hidden weapon as a standard action.     Special: A ~fighter~[TAG_FIGHTERS] may select Quick Draw as one of his fighter bonus feats.

A spell whose casting time is more than 1 full-round action cannot be quickened.  A quickened spell uses up a spell slot four levels higher than the spell's actual level.  Casting a quickened spell doesn't provoke an ~attack of opportunity~[TAG_AOO].

Scribing a scroll takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price.  The base price of a scroll is its spell level x its caster level x 25 gp.  To scribe a scroll, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use raw materials costing one-half of this base price.       Any scroll that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost.

TAG_STUNNING_FIST	TAG_FEATS_DES			Stunning Fist	You know how to strike opponents in vulnerable areas.     Benefit: You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt).  Stunning Fist forces a foe damaged by ~unarmed attack~[TAG_WEAPONS_STRIKE_UNARMED] to make a ~Fortitude~[TAG_FORTITUDE] saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your ~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM] modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally.  A defender who fails this saving throw is stunned for 1 round (until just before your next action).  A stunned character can't act, loses any ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] bonus to AC, and takes a -2 penalty to AC.  You may attempt a stunning attack once per day for every four levels you have attained, and no more than once per round.

If your rank in Survival is greater than or equal to the creature's CR, you are able to see the direction and the creature type.  Tracks of repeated creature types are not visible to you; for example, if there are two sets of human tracks, you see only one of them.  The most creature or monster types you can identify is 5.     Normal: Without this feat, you will not be able to tell the general direction of a creature's path nor will you be able to identify its type.     Special: You can only gain this feat once.      A ~ranger~[TAG_RANGERS] automatically has Track as a bonus feat.

You can make one extra attack each round with the second weapon.     Prerequisite: ~Dex~[TAG_DEXTERITY] 15.     Benefit: Your penalties on attack rolls for fighting with two weapons are reduced.

You are especially good at using this weapon.  (If you have chosen ray, you are especially good with rays, such as the one produced by the ~Ray of Frost~[TAG_SPELLS_RAY_OF_FROST] spell).     Prerequisite: Proficiency with selected weapon, base attack bonus +1.     Benefit: You gain a +1 bonus on all attack rolls you make using the selected weapon.     Special: You can gain this feat multiple times.

TAG_FEATS_DES	TAG_FEATS			Feat Descriptions	[CMD_CHILDREN_SORTED]
TAG_ALIGNMENT	TAG_DESCRIPTION			Alignment	[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_RELIGION	TAG_DESCRIPTION			Religion	You may select a patron deity for your character. Alternatively, you may choose to have your character NOT have a patron deity.  However, if you choose to select NONE as your character's deity, he/she cannot be a cleric, nor will he/she ever be able to take a level of cleric as a multi-class.Deities are restricted by race, class, and alignment. On the deity selection screen, only those deities appropriate for your character's race, class, and alignment will be available. Available deities are as follows:[CMD_CHILDREN]

TAG_LAWFUL_GOOD	TAG_ALIGNMENT			Lawful Good, "Crusader"	A lawful good character acts as a good person is expected or required to act.  She combines a commitment to oppose evil with the discipline to fight relentlessly.  She tells the truth, keeps her word, helps those in need, and speaks out against injustice.  A lawful good character hates to see the guilty go unpunished.       Lawful good can be a positive alignment because it combines honor and compassion.
TAG_NEUTRAL_GOOD	TAG_ALIGNMENT			Neutral Good, "Benefactor"	A neutral good character does the best that a good person can do.  He is devoted to helping others.  He works best with kings and magistrates but does not feel beholden to them.  For example, a ~cleric~[TAG_CLERICS] who helps others according to their needs is neutral good.     Neutral good is an advantageous alignment because it means doing what is good without bias for or against order. 
TAG_CHAOTIC_GOOD	TAG_ALIGNMENT			Chaotic Good, "Rebel"	A chaotic good character acts as his conscience directs him with little regard for what others expect of him.  He makes his own way, but he's kind and benevolent.  He believes in goodness and right but has little use for laws and regulations.  He hates it when people try to intimidate others and tell them what to do.  He follows his own moral compass, which although good, may not agree with that of society.  For example, a ~ranger~[TAG_RANGERS] who waylays the evil baron's tax collectors is chaotic good.     Chaotic Good is favored by some because it combines a good heart with a free spirit.  
TAG_LAWFUL_NEUTRAL	TAG_ALIGNMENT			Lawful Neutral, "Judge"	A lawful neutral character acts as law, tradition, or a personal code directs her.  Order and organization are paramount to her.  She may believe in personal order and live by a code or standard, or she may believe in order for all and favor a strong, organized government.  For example, a ~monk~[TAG_MONKS] who follows her discipline without being swayed either by the demands of those in need or by the temptations of evil, is lawful neutral.     Lawful neutral is considered a good alignment because it means you are reliable and honorable without being a zealot.
TAG_NEUTRAL	TAG_ALIGNMENT			Neutral, "Undecided"	A neutral character does what seems to be a good idea.  He doesn't feel strongly one way or the other when it comes to good vs. evil or law vs. chaos.  Most neutral characters exhibit a lack of conviction or bias rather than commitment to neutrality.  Such a character thinks of good as better than evil--after all, he would rather have good neighbors and rulers than evil ones.  Still, he's not personally committed to upholding good in any abstract or universal way.  For example, a ~wizard~[TAG_WIZARDS] who devotes himself to his art and is bored by the semantics of moral debate is neutral.     Some neutral characters, on the other hand, commit themselves philosophically to neutrality.  They see good, evil, law, and chaos as prejudices and dangerous extremes.  They advocate the middle way of neutrality as the best, most balanced road in the long run.     Neutral is an alignment favored because it means you can act naturally, without prejudice or compulsion.
TAG_CHAOTIC_NEUTRAL	TAG_ALIGNMENT			Chaotic Neutral, "Free Spirit"	A chaotic neutral character follows her whims.  She is an individualist first and foremost.  She values her own liberty but doesn't strive to protect others' freedom.  She avoids authority, resents restrictions, and challenges traditions.  A chaotic neutral character does not intentionally disrupt organizations as part of a campaign of anarchy.  To do so, she would have to be motivated either by good (and a desire to liberate others) or evil (and a desire to make those different from herself suffer).  A chaotic neutral character may be unpredictable, but her behavior is not totally random.  She is not as likely to jump off a bridge as to cross it.  For example, a ~bard~[TAG_BARDS] who wanders the land living by his wits is chaotic neutral.     Chaotic neutral is thought of as the best alignment by some because it represents true freedom from both society's restrictions and a do-gooder's zeal.
TAG_LAWFUL_EVIL	TAG_ALIGNMENT			Lawful Evil, "Dominator"	A lawful evil methodically takes what he wants within the limits of his code of conduct without regard for whom it hurts.  He cares about tradition, loyalty, and order, but not about freedom, dignity, or life.  He plays by the rules but without mercy or compassion.  He is comfortable in a hierarchy and would like to rule, but is willing to serve.  He condemns others not according to their actions but according to race, religion, homeland, or social rank.  He is loath to break laws or promises.  This reluctance comes partly from his nature and partly because he depends on order to protect himself from those who oppose him on moral grounds.  Some lawful evil villains have particular taboos, such as not killing in cold blood (but having underlings do it) or not letting children come to harm (if it can be helped).  They imagine that these compunctions put them above unprincipled villains.  The scheming baron who expands his power and exploits his people is lawful evil.     Some lawful evil people and creatures commit themselves to evil with a zeal like that of a crusader committed to good.  Beyond being willing to hurt others for their own ends, they take pleasure in spreading evil as an end unto itself.  They may also see doing evil as part of a duty to an evil deity or master.     Lawful evil is sometimes called "diabolical" because devils are the epitome of this alignment.     Lawful evil is a dangerous alignment because is represents methodical, intentional, and frequently successful evil.
TAG_NEUTRAL_EVIL	TAG_ALIGNMENT			Neutral Evil, "Malefactor"	A neutral evil villain does whatever she can get away with.  She is out for herself, pure and simple.  She sheds no tears for those she kills, whether for profit, sport, or convenience.  She has no love of order and holds no illusion that following laws, traditions, or codes would make her any better or more noble.  On the other hand, she doesn't have the reckless nature or love of conflict that a chaotic evil villain has.  The criminal who robs and murders to get what she wants is neutral evil.     Some neutral evil villains hold up evil as an ideal, committing evil for its own sake.  Most often, such villains are devoted to evil deities or secret societies.     Neutral evil is considered to be a dangerous alignment because it represents pure evil without honor and without variation.
TAG_CHAOTIC_EVIL	TAG_ALIGNMENT			Chaotic Evil, "Destroyer"	A chaotic evil character does whatever his greed, hatred, and lust for destruction drive him to do.  He is hot-tempered, vicious, arbitrarily violent, and unpredictable.  If he is simply out for whatever he can get, he is ruthless and brutal.  If he is committed to the spread of evil and chaos, he is even worse.  Thankfully, his plans are haphazard, and any groups he joins or forms are poorly organized.  Typically, chaotic evil people can be made to work together only by force, and their leader lasts only as long as he can thwart attempts to topple or assassinate him.  The demented sorcerer pursuing mad schemes of vengeance and havoc is chaotic evil.     Chaotic evil is sometimes called "demonic" because demons are the epitome of this particular alignment.     Chaotic evil is thought of as dangerous because it represents the destruction not only of beauty and life but also of the order on which beauty and life depend.
TAG_BOCCOB	TAG_RELIGION			Boccob	The god of magic, Boccob (bock-obb) is ~neutral~[TAG_NEUTRAL].  His titles include the Uncaring, Lord of All Magics, and Archmage of the Deities.

In civilized lands, his followers (including evil ~fighters~[TAG_FIGHTERS], ~barbarians~[TAG_BARBARIANS], and ~rogues~[TAG_ROGUES]) form small criminal cults.  In savage lands, evil barbarians, gnolls, bugbears, ogres, and trolls commonly worship him.

TAG_ACTION_COST	TAG_COMBAT			Action Cost	[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_STANDARD_ACTION	TAG_ACTION_COST			Standard Actions	All of the following are considered standard actions:1. Attack. An attack can be a standard melee attack, an unarmed attack, which provokes an ~attack of opportunity~[TAG_AOO], or a ranged attack. Melee attacks can be done for nonlethal damage at a penalty on the attack roll and unarmed attacks can be done for lethal damage at a similar penalty. Some attacks might do extra damage as a result of a critical hit.2. Cast a spell. Most spells require a standard action as noted in their description. Casting a spell in an enemy's threat range provokes an attack of opportunity. Depending on distractions, a concentration check may also be required. 3. Activate Magic Item. 4. Use Special Ability.5. Total Defense. This gives your character a +4 Dodge bonus to his AC for one full turn.6. Start/Complete Full-Round Action. A character restricted to Standard Actions only can spend his Standard Action to start a Full-Round Action and complete it the next round during his Standard Action.
TAG_MOVEMENT_ACTION	TAG_ACTION_COST			Movement Actions	The following are considered to be move actions during combat:1. Move. You may move your character up to his standard ~movement rate~[TAG_MOVEMENT_RATE]. Note that moving through or out of a threatened square provokes an ~attack of opportunity~[TAG_AOO].2. Draw or Sheathe a Weapon.3. Ready or Loose a Shield.4. Manipulate an Item.5. Direct or Redirect a Spell. Some spells allow you to redirect the effect to new targets or areas after you cast the spell.

TAG_FREE_ACTION	TAG_ACTION_COST			Free Actions	Free actions don't take any time at all and can be performed without limit. These are as follows:1. Drop an Item.2. Drop prone.3. Speak. 4. Cease Concentration Spell5. Cast a Quickened Spell
TAG_SPECIAL_ATTACKS	TAG_COMBAT			Special Attacks	[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_SPECIAL_INIT	TAG_COMBAT			Special Initiative Actions	  Delay: If you would prefer for your character to move after someone else within the combat round, you can elect to Delay your action. To do this, simply click and drag the character portrait at the top of the screen to the location in the order of when you would like that character to act. However, if the character has already taken his turn, moving him to a lower initiative will not allow him to act again, and if he has not yet taken his actions for his turn, then moving him to an initiative higher than the current combatant will forfeit his turn for this round.  Ready: You may also choose to Ready an action, dependent on something that the enemy does, such as prepare to cast a spell or shoot a bow. In this case, as soon as the condition is achieved, the character will immediately enact his readied action. If the condition is not achieved, then that character fails to act in that round.
TAG_SURPRISE	TAG_COMBAT			Surprise Round	In combat, if one or more characters gain surprise, they are allowed to act in the surprise round, before anyone else gets a chance to react. Characters not acting in the surprise round are ~flat-footed~[TAG_FLAT_FOOTED]. Characters are allowed to make one ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION] in the surprise round and as many ~free actions~[TAG_FREE_ACTION] as they want. 
TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION	TAG_COMBAT			Full-Round Actions	[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_FASCINATED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS	TAG_EXHAUSTED		Fascinated	A fascinated creature is entranced by a supernatural or spell effect.  The creature stands or sits quietly, taking no actions other than to pay attention to the fascinating effects, for as long as the effect lasts.  It takes a -4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN] and ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT] checks.  Any potential threat, such as a hostile creature approaching, allows the fascinated creature a new saving throw against the fascinating effect.  Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at the fascinated creature, automatically breaks the effect.  A fascinated creature's ally may shake it free of the spell as a ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION].  
TAG_SICKENED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS	TAG_PRONE		Sickened	The character takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, ~saving throws~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC], ~skill~[TAG_SKILLS] checks, and ~ability~[TAG_THE_ABILITIES] checks.

TAG_BULLRUSH	TAG_SPECIAL_ATTACKS			Bull Rush	To make a bull rush, you attempt to push an enemy back. You initiate this by moving into your opponent's square, which provokes an ~attack of opportunity~[TAG_AOO].Then you make opposed Strength checks.  If you succeed, you can push your opponent back 5 feet.
TAG_CHARGE	TAG_SPECIAL_ATTACKS			Charge	You must move at least 10 feet and as much as double your normal speed directly toward your opponent. After moving, you may make a single attack, which results in a +2 bonus on the attack roll. You also take a -2 penalty to your AC until the start of your next turn. 
TAG_FEINT	TAG_SPECIAL_ATTACKS			Feint	To feint, make a ~Bluff~[TAG_BLUFF] check opposed by a ~Sense Motive~[TAG_SENSE_MOTIVE] check by your target. If your Bluff check result exceeds your target's Sense Motive check result, the next ~melee attack~[TAG_MELEE_ATTACKS]  you make against the target does not allow him to use his ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] bonus to AC.
TAG_GRAPPLE	TAG_SPECIAL_ATTACKS			Grapple	Grappling means wrestling and struggling hand-to-hand. It's tricky to perform, but sometimes you want to pin foes instead of killing them, and sometimes you have no choice in the matter.Your attack bonus on a grapple check is:Base Attack Bonus + ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] modifier + special size modifierThe steps to attempt a grapple are:1. Provoke an ~attack of opportunity~[TAG_AOO]2. Perform a melee touch attack to grap the opponent3. Make an opposed grapple check as a ~free action~[TAG_FREE_ACTION].If you succeed, your opponent is ~grappled~[TAG_GRAPPLING].
TAG_TRIP	TAG_SPECIAL_ATTACKS			Trip	To make a trip attack, make an unarmed melee touch attack against your target. This provokes an ~attack of opportunity~[TAG_AOO] from your target as normal for unarmed attacks. If your attack succeeds, make a Strength check opposed by the defender's ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] or ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] check (whichever has the higher modifier).  If you win, you trip the defender. If you lose, the defender may immediately react and make a Strength check opposed by your Dexterity or Strength check to try to trip you.A combatant gets a +4 bonus for every size category he is larger than medium.  He gets a -4 penalty for every size category he is smaller than medium.  A defender gets a +4 bonus if  he has more than two legs or is otherwise more stable than a normal humanoid (such as a ~dwarf~[TAG_DWARVES]).  Some creatures, such as those which fly or slither like a snake, cannot be tripped.
TAG_TURN	TAG_SPECIAL_ATTACKS			Turn or Rebuke Undead	Good ~clerics~[TAG_CLERICS], ~paladins~[TAG_PALADINS], and some neutral clerics can channel positive energy to halt, drive off (rout), or destroy undead.Evil clerics and some neutral clerics can channel negative energy to hold, awe (rebuke), control (command), or bolster undead. Regardless of the effect, the general term for the activity is called "turning."
TAG_TWO_WEAPONS	TAG_SPECIAL_ATTACKS			Two Weapon Fighting	If you wield a second weapon in your off hand, you can get one extra attack per round with that weapon. Fighting in this way is very hard, however, and you suffer a -6 penalty to your regular attack or attacks with your primary hand and a -10 penalty to the attack with your off hand. You can reduce these penalties if your off-hand weapon is light, such as a ~short sword~[TAG_WEAPONS_SWORD_SHORT], or you have the ~Two-Weapon Fighting~[TAG_TWO_FIGHTING] feat.
TAG_FULL_ATTACK	TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION			Full Attack	A full attack allows you to use all of your attacks in a given round, if you have multiple attacks. If you do not have multiple attacks, you do not need to use this attack.You may have multiple attacks because your Base Attack Bonus is high enough to allow it or you use two weapons to fight.To make a full attack, select full attack from the radial menu.  The number of attacks you have will be indicated by a number next to the cursor.  Click on an opponent to use an attack.  You may also use ~Trip~[TAG_TRIP], ~Stunning Fist~[TAG_STUNNING_FIST], ~Throw~[TAG_THROW_WEAPON], make a ~touch attack~[TAG_HOLDING_A_CHARGE], or other actions from the radial menu which are equivalent to an attack.
TAG_CAST_FULL	TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION			Casting a Spell (Full Round)	Some spells require a full round to cast. Others may be cast in a full round if a bard or sorcerer chooses to make a standard action spell a metamagic one.
TAG_USE_FULL	TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION			Use Special Ability (Full Round)	Depending on the special ability, some require a full-round action to execute.
TAG_WITHDRAW	TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION			Withdraw	You can move away from an opponent at double your ~movement rate~[TAG_MOVEMENT_RATE], without provoking an attack of opportunity, using this a full round action.
TAG_RUN	TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION			Run	A character can run as a full-round action up to 4 times his or her normal ~movement rate~[TAG_MOVEMENT_RATE] in a straight line. A character will run at 3 times his or her normal speed if they are wearing heavy armor. Running provokes an ~attack of opportunity~[TAG_AOO].

TAG_MASTERWORK	TAG_WEAPONS			Masterwork Weapons and Armor	A masterwork weapon is a finely crafted version of a normal weapon. Wielding it provides a +1 enchantment bonus on attack rolls. This is NOT a magical attack, nor is the weapon considered magical. However, all magic weapons are considered to be masterwork, although the +1 enchantment bonus does NOT stack with magical bonuses.Just as with weapons, armor can be crafted as masterwork. Masterwork armor reduces the armor check penalties by 1. ~Thieves'  tools~[TAG_THIEVES_TOOLS] can also be rated as masterwork, giving bonuses to skill checks requiring the use of thieves'  tools.

Simply move the cursor over the type of action you wish to perform and further spokes will extend out of the menu as necessary until your desired choice of action appears.   All actions are color coded during ~combat~[TAG_COMBAT] so that any  that will complete actions for your turn (except free actions) are yellow, any that will allow for further actions to take place are green, and any that are not allowed this turn are red.The radial menu features four icons from which the spokes emanate.  1) Combat (sword icon):           Options:                       ~AutoEnd Turn~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_AUTOEND_TURN]                       Deal ~Nonlethal Damage~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_NONLETHAL_DAMAGE]                        ~Cast Defensively~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_CAST_DEFENSIVELY]           Tactical:                        ~Ready~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_READY] vs. Spell (ready an action vs. cast a spell)          Offense:                        ~Power Attack~[TAG_POWER_ATTACK]                        ~Feint~[TAG_FEINT]                        ~Coup de Grace~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_COUP_DE_GRACE]                        ~Trip~[TAG_TRIP] Attack                        ~Charge~[TAG_CHARGE] Attack                        ~Total Defense~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_TOTAL_DEFENSE]                        ~Fight Defensively~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_FIGHT_DEFENSIVELY]                        ~Full Attack~[TAG_FULL_ATTACK]                        ~Standard Attack~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION]          Movement:                             ~Run~[TAG_RUN]                             ~Move~[TAG_ADVENTURING_MOVE]                             ~Double Move~[TAG_ADVENTURING_DOUBLE_MOVE]                             ~5-foot Step~[TAG_5_FOOT_STEP]2) Inventory (backpack icon):          Will be able to select and view your character's ~skills~[TAG_SKILLS], ~feats~[TAG_FEATS], ~spells~[TAG_SPELLS], ~abilities~[TAG_THE_ABILITIES]; as well as view items and basic character stats.           3) Skills (tools icon):          ~Heal~[TAG_HEAL]          ~Sneak~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_SNEAK]          ~Search~[TAG_SEARCH] (concentrated)4) Person icon:         Clicking on this icon will make the "Talk" option appear.

TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS	TAG_MAGIC			Magic Schools	The magic schools are:~Abjuration~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_ABJURATION]~Conjuration~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_CONJURATION]~Divination~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_DIVINATION]~Enchantment~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_ENCHANTMENT]~Evocation~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_EVOCATION]~Illusion~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_ILLUSION]~Necromancy~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_NECROMANCY]~Transmutation~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_TRANSMUTATION]
TAG_ARCANE_SPELLS	TAG_MAGIC			Arcane Spells	~Wizards~[TAG_WIZARDS], ~sorcerers~[TAG_SORCERERS], and ~bards~[TAG_BARDS] can cast arcane spells, which involve the direct manipulation of mystic energies. These manipulations require natural talent (in the case of sorcerers), long study (in the case of wizards), or both (in the case of bards). Compared to ~divine spells~[TAG_DIVINE_SPELLS], arcane spells are more likely to produce dramatic results, such as flight, explosions, or transformations.~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE] is the key attribute for wizard spells, while ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA] is the key attribute for sorcerers and bards.Wizards must rest each day to regain spells. Spells must be prepared each day from their available list, filling each slot with a spell. Spells intended to be used more than once must take a slot for each intended casting.Sorcerers and bards also rest to regain spells. However, they do not need to fill slots with particular spells. They can cast any spell from their spell list, as long as they still have enough spell slots to cast.Arcane spells may be subject to ~failure~[TAG_ARCANE_SPELL_FAILURE] if the caster is wearing armor.
TAG_DIVINE_SPELLS	TAG_MAGIC			Divine Spells	~Clerics~[TAG_CLERICS], ~druids~[TAG_DRUIDS], experienced ~paladins~[TAG_PALADINS], and experienced ~rangers~[TAG_RANGERS] can cast divine spells. Unlike ~arcane spells~[TAG_ARCANE_SPELLS], divine spells draw power from a divine source. Clerics gain spell power from deities or from divine forces. The divine forces of nature power druids' and rangers' spells. The divine powers of law and good power paladins' spells. Divine spells tend to focus on healing and protection and are less flashy, destructive, and disruptive than arcane spells.~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM] is the key attribute for casting divine spells and controls the highest level of spells the character may have.A divine caster is required to rest to regain spells. They must prepare which spells they wish to cast for the next day by filling in available slots. Clerics channeling positive energy can substitute a heal spell for any spell in their list, while negative channeling clerics can substitute harm spells. This is called ~spontaneous casting~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_CLERIC_SPONTANEOUS_CASTING].
TAG_NORMAL_GAME	TAG_INTERFACE_HELP			Normal Mode	The normal game allows you to reroll your character's ability points and load and save your game whenever you want. This is in contrast to the ~ironman~[TAG_IRONMAN] game which gives you only one roll for your character's abilities and does not allow you to return to past saved games. 
TAG_MISC_ACTION	TAG_COMBAT			Miscellaneous Actions	These actions do not fit neatly into any category. They are as follows:1. Take a ~5-foot step~[TAG_5_FOOT_STEP]. A character may make one 5-foot step per round, and you can't take a 5-foot step in a round when your character moves any distance. Taking a 5-foot step does NOT provoke an ~attack of opportunity~[TAG_AOO], but it is the only movement that character can do that round.1. Use a ~feat~[TAG_FEATS]. Each feat has its own dependencies for combat, and some are not allowed in combat at all. Refer to the feats list for detailed descriptions.2. Use a ~skill~[TAG_SKILLS]. Most skills require a standard action, but some may be different. Refer to the skills list for detailed descriptions.
TAG_DOMAINS	TAG_SPELLS			Domain Spells	Depending on their deity, ~clerics~[TAG_CLERICS] receive extra spells according to the domains their deity has access to, and the cleric chooses two domains.Possible cleric domains are:[CMD_CHILDREN]

This alteration changes each animal's size category to the next largest (from Large to Huge, for example), grants it a +8 size bonus to ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] and a +4 size bonus to ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION] (and thus an extra 2 hit points per HD), and imposes a -2 size penalty to ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY].  The creature's existing natural armor bonus increases by 2.  The size change also affects the animal's modifier to AC, attack rolls, and its base damage.  The animal's reach will change, but the animal's space and speed will not.  All equipment worn or carried by an animal is similarly enlarged by the spell, though this change has no effect on the magical properties of any such equipment.  Any enlarged item that leaves the enlarged creature's possession instantly returns to its normal size.    The spell gives no means of command or influence over the enlarged animals.  Multiple magical effects that increases size do not stack, which means that you can't use a second casting of this spell to further increase the size of an animal that's still under the effect of the first casting.

The effect grants a +2 enhancement bonus to the creature's existing natural armor bonus.  This enhancement bonus increases by 1 for every three caster levels above 3rd, to a maximum of +4 at caster level 9th.  The enhancement bonus provided by Barkskin stacks with the target's natural armor bonus, but not with other enhancement bonuses to natural armor.

If the attacker can see invisible creatures, the miss chance is only 20%.  Likewise, your own attacks have a 20% miss chance, since you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike.   --Any individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against you while you're blinking unless your attacker can target invisible creatures.  Your own spells have a 20% chance of activating just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material Plane.  Force effects (such as ~Magic Missile~[TAG_SPELLS_MAGIC_MISSILE]) and abjurations affect you normally.   --While blinking, you take only half damage from area attacks.  You strike as an invisible creature (with a +2 bonus on attack rolls), denying your target any ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] bonus to AC.

Break Enchantment can reverse even an instantaneous effect.  For each such effect, there is a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum of +10) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect.  Success means that the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect.  For a cursed magic item, the DC is 25.  If the spell is one that cannot be dispelled by ~Dispel Magic~[TAG_SPELLS_DISPEL_MAGIC], Break Enchantment works only if that level is 5th level or lower.  For instance, ~Bestow Curse~[TAG_SPELLS_BESTOW_CURSE] cannot be dispelled by Dispel Magic, but Break Enchantment can dispel it.  If the effect comes from some permanent magic item, such as a cursed sword, Break Enchantment does not remove the curse from the item, but it does free the victim from the item's effects.  For example, a cursed item can change the alignment of its user.  Break Enchantment allows the victim to be rid of the item and negates the alignment change, but the item's curse is intact and affects the next creature to pick up the item--even if it's the recent recipient of the Break Enchantment spell.

The bolt of lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke at whatever target point you choose within the spell's range (measured from your position at the time).  Any creature in the target square or in the path of the bolt is affected.  You need not call a bolt of lightning immediately; other actions, even spell-casting, can be performed.  However, each round after the first, you may use a standard action (concentrating on the spell) to call a bolt.  You may call a total number of bolts equal to your caster level (maximum of 10 bolts).  If you are outdoors, each bolt deals 3d10 points of electricity damage instead of 3d6.    This spell function indoors or underground as well.

The maximum number of Hit Dice of animals you can affect is equal to 2d4 + caster level.    The affected creatures remain where they are and do not attack or flee.

You have no control over the affected creatures, but Calm Emotion can stop raging creatures from fighting or joyous ones from reveling.  Creatures so affected cannot take violent actions (although they can defend themselves) or do anything destructive.  Any aggressive action against or damage dealt to a calmed creature immediately breaks the spell on all calmed creatures.  This spell automatically suppresses (but does not dispel) any morale bonuses granted by spells such as ~Bless~[TAG_SPELLS_BLESS], ~Good Hope~[TAG_SPELLS_GOOD_HOPE], and ~Rage~[TAG_SPELLS_RAGE], as well as negating a bard's ability to inspire courage or a barbarian's rage ability.  It also suppresses any fear effects and removes the ~confused~[TAG_CONFUSED] condition from all targets.  While the spell lasts, a suppressed spell or effect has no effect.  When the Calm Emotions spell ends, the original spell or effect takes hold of the creature again, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.

After it strikes, lightning can arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your caster level (maximum 10).  The secondary bolts each strike one target and deal half as much damage as the primary one did.    Each target can attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage.  You choose secondary targets as you like, but they must all be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no target can be struck more than once.

A slowed creature can take only a single standard action or ~move action~[TAG_MOVEMENT_ACTION] on each of its turns, plus free actions as usual.  In addition, it takes a -2 penalty to AC, attack rolls, damage rolls, and ~Reflex~[TAG_REFLEX] saves.  A successful Will save reduces the damage by half and negates the slow effect.  The spell deals only half damage against creatures who are neither lawful nor chaotic, and they are not slowed.

Unattended, nonmagical metal gets no saving throw.  Magical metal is allowed a saving throw against the spell.  An item in the creature's possession uses the creature's saving throw bonus unless its own is higher.    Only a creature wearing metal armor takes any cold damage and will be fully affected if its metal armor is chilled. The creature takes minimum damage (1 or 2 points) if it's not wearing metal armor.  First round of the spell: the metal becomes chilly and uncomfortable to the touch but deals no damage.  The same effects also occurs on the last round (the Seventh) of the spell's duration.   Second round (and also the Sixth): icy coldness causes pain and damage (1d4 points of damage).  Third, Fourth, and Fifth rounds: the metal is freezing cold, causing more damage (2d4 points of damage).Any heat intense enough to damage the creature negates cold damage from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-for-point basis.  For example, if the damage roll from a Chill Metal spell indicates 5 points of cold damage and the subject plunges through a fire spell in the same round and takes 10 points of damage, it winds up taking no cold damage and only 5 points of fire damage.  Chill Metal counters and dispels ~Heat Metal~[TAG_SPELLS_HEAT_METAL].

You can use dispel magic to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magical item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their affects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster's spell.  A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired.  Some spells, as detailed in their  descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic.  Dispel Magic can dispel (but not counter) the ongoing effects of supernatural abilities as well as spells , and it affects spell-like effects just as it does spells.Note: The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect.  Thus, you can't use dispel magic to repair fire damage caused by a fireball or to turn a petrified character back to flesh.  In these cases, the magic has departed, leaving only burned flesh or perfectly normal stone in it's wake.You choose to use dispel magic in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell:  Targeted Dispell:  One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell.  You can make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against the spell or against the each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature.  The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell's caster level. If you target an object or creature that is under the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by Monster Summoning), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object  or creature.  You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.Area Dispel:  When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 30-ft. radius.  For each creature within the area that is the subject  of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the last cast spell back to the first cast spell until you dispel one spell (which discharges the dispel magic spell so far as that target is concerned).  The creature's magic items are not affected.For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the dispel magic spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object  or creature (returning it from whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object.Counterspell:  When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell.  Unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel magic may not work;  you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.

Each round, the spell absorbs the first 5 ponts of damage the creature would otherwise take from the specified energy type, regardless of whether the source of the damage is natural or magical.  The spell protects the recipient's equipment as well.Endure Elements absorbs only damage.  The character can still suffer unfortunate side effects, such as drowning in acid (since drowning damage comes from lack of oxygen) or becoming encased in ice.  Note: Endure Elements overlaps (and does not stack with) Resist Energy and Protection From Energy.  If a character is warded by Protection From Energy and one or both of the other spells, the protection spell absorbs damage until it is exhausted.

The affected creature is unable to use Intelligence- or Charisma-based skills, cast spells, understand language, or communicate coherently.  Still, it knows who its friends are and can follow them and even protect them.  The subject remains in this state until a heal spell is used to cancel the effect of the feeblemind.  A creature that can cast arcane spells, such as a sorcerer or a wizard, takes a -4 penalty on its saving throw.

The flames also protect you from either cold-based or fire-based attacks (your choice).Any creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 point of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +10).  This damage is either cold damage (if the shield protects against fire-based attacks) or fire damage (if the shield protects against cold-based attacks).  If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies to this effect.  Creatures wielding weapons with exceptional reach, such as ~longspears~[TAG_WEAPONS_LONGSPEAR], are not subject to this damage if they attack you.Warm shield:  The flames are warm to the touch.  You only take half damage from cold-based attacks.  If such an attack allows a ~Reflex~[TAG_REFLEX] save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save.Cold shield:  The flames are cool to the touch.  You only take half damage from fire-based attacks.  If such an attack allows a reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save.

Unattended objects also take this damage.  The explosion creates almost no pressure.You point your finger and determine the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst.  A glowing pea-sized bead streaks from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball at that point.

The spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6).  Half the damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks, such as that granted by ~Protection From Energy~[TAG_SPELLS_PROTECTION_FROM_ENERGY] (fire), ~Fire Shield~[TAG_SPELLS_FIRE_SHIELD] (chill shield), and similar magic.

The subject gains damage reduction 10/magic (i.e. the target can absorb damage up to 10 points, unless it is magic damage) and becomes immune to poison and critical hits.  It can't attack or cast spells with verbal, somatic, or material components while in gaseous form.

A nonintelligent undead creature (such as a skeleton or zombie) gets no ~saving throw~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC]; an intelligent undead creature does.

This extra speed has several effects.    When making a full attack action, a hasted creature may make one extra attack with any weapon it is holding.  The attack is made using the creature's full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation.  (This effect is not cumulative with similar effects such as that provided by a weapon of speed, nor does it actually grant an extra action, so you can't use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round).  A Hasted creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and ~Reflex~[TAG_REFLEX] saves.  Any condition that makes you lose your ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses.   All of the hasted creature's movements increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice the subject's normal speed.

Magical metal is allowed a saving throw against the spell.  Only a creature wearing metal armor is affected by this spell.  A creature takes fire damage if its armor is heated.  It takes full damage if its armor is affected.  The creature takes minimum damage (1 or 2 points) if it's not wearing metal armor. First round of the spell (results are the same for the Seventh round): The metal becomes warm and uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage.Second (and Sixth round): Intense heat causes pain and damage (1d4 points of damage).Third, Fourth, and Fifth rounds: The metal is searing hot, causing more damage (2d4 points of damage).  Any cold intense enough to damage the creature negates fire damage from the spell (and vice-versa) on a point-for-point basis.  For example, if the damage roll from a Heat Metal spell indicates 2 points of fire damage and the subject is hit by a ~Ray of Frost~[TAG_SPELLS_RAY_OF_FROST] in the same round and takes 3 points of cold damage,  the subject winds up taking no fire damage and only 1 point of cold damage.  Heat Metal counters and dispels ~Chill Metal~[TAG_SPELLS_CHILL_METAL].

When Magic Circle is cast on the spellcaster or a friendly creature, the spell is considered to be focused outward.  All creatures within the area gain the effects of a ~Protection From Evil~[TAG_SPELLS_PROTECTION_FROM_EVIL], and no nongood summoned or conjured creatures can enter the area either.  You must overcome a creature's spell resistance in order to keep it at bay, but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies' spell resistance.  When Magic Circle is cast on a hostile creature, the spell is considered to be focused inward.  In this case, the spell binds a nongood called creature and causes the creature to become immobile, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the Magic Circle.  In the game, casting the spell against a hostile creature results in the circle being considered inward.  Likewise, in ToEE, the creature cannot cross the circle's boundaries unless it succeeds at a spell resistance check, at which point it is allowed to move.  If the Magic Circle is cast against a friendly creature, the spell/circle is defined as inward.  The creature trapped within the circle can do nothing that directly or indirectly disturbs the circle, but other creatures can.  A creature capable of casting ~Dimension Door~[TAG_SPELLS_DIMENSION_DOOR] can simply leave the circle through means of that spell.  You can prevent the creature's extradimensional escape by casting a ~Dimension Anchor~[TAG_SPELLS_DIMENSIONAL_ANCHOR] spell on it, but you must act before the creature acts.  The creature cannot reach across the magic circle, but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can.

The area of effect of any such spells does not include the area of the Lesser Globe of Invulnerability.  Such spells fail to affect any target located within the globe.  Excluded efforts include spell-like abilities and spells or spell-like effects from items.  However, any type of spell can be cast through or out of the magical globe.  Spells of 4th level and higher are not affected by the globe, nor are spells already in effect when the globe is cast.  The globe can be brought down by a targeted ~Dispel Magic~[TAG_SPELLS_DISPEL_MAGIC] spell, but not by an area Dispel Magic.  Note that spell effects are not disrupted unless their effects enter the globe, and even then they are merely suppressed, not dispelled.  For example, creatures inside the globe would still see a ~Mirror Image~[TAG_SPELLS_MIRROR_IMAGE] created by a caster outside the globe.

This chance is determined randomly and any successful attack against an image destroys it. An image's AC is 10 + your size modifier + your ~Dex~[TAG_DEXTERITY] modifier.     An attacker must be able to see the images to be fooled.

It then guards the area where it was conjured (it does not move).  The hound immediately starts barking loudly if any Small or larger creature approaches within 30 feet of it.    If an intruder approaches to within 5 feet of the hound, the dog stops barking and delivers a vicious bite (+10 attack bonus, 2d6+3 points of piercing damage) once per round.  The dog also gets the bonuses appropriate for an invisible creature.  The dog is considered ready to bite intruders, so it delivers its first bite on the intruder's turn.  Its bite is the equivalent of a magic weapon for the purpose of damage reduction.  The hound cannot be attacked, but it can be dispelled.  The spells lasts for 1 hour per caster level, but once the hound begins barking, it lasts only 1 round per caster level.

A poisoned creature suffers no additional effects from the poison, and any temporary effects are ended, but the spell does not reverse instantaneous effects, such as hit point damage, temporary ability damage, or effects that don't go away on their own.  For example, if a poison has dealt 3 points of ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION] damage to a character and threatens to deal more damage later, this spell prevents the future damage but does not repair the damage already done.  The creature is immune to any poison it is exposed to during the duration of the spell.  Unlike with ~Delay Poison~[TAG_SPELLS_DELAY_POISON], such effects aren't postponed until after the duration--the creature need not make any saves against poison effects applied to it during the length of the spell.  This spell can instead neutralize the poison in a poisonous creature or object for the duration of the spell, at the caster's option.

A successful Will save reduces the damage to half and negates the daze effect.  The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither chaotic nor lawful, and they are not dazed.

It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot.  The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects.  First, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves.  Both of these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures.  Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature or to exercise mental control over the creature (including enchantment (charm) effects and enchantment (compulsion) effects that grant the caster ongoing control over the subject as ~Dominate Person~[TAG_SPELLS_DOMINATE_PERSON]).  The protection prevents such effects from targeting the protected creature.  If the Protection From Evil effect ends before the effect granting mental control does, the would-be controller would then be able to mentally command the controlled creature.  This second effect works regardless of alignment.  Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned or conjured creatures.  This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature.  Good elementals and outsiders are immune to this effect.  The protection against contact by summoned or conjured creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature.

The subject gains energy resistance 10 against the energy type chosen, meaning that each time the creature is subjected to such damage (whether from a natural or magical source), that damage is reduced by 10 points before being applied to the creature's hit points.  The value of the energy resistance granted increases to 20 points at 7th level.  The spell protects the recipient's equipment as well.  Resist energy absorbs only damage.  Note: Resist Energy overlaps (and does not stack with) ~Protection From Energy~[TAG_SPELLS_PROTECTION_FROM_ENERGY].

For example, if a character experiences Level Loss and his XP was drained from 7000 points at 4th level to 5000 points (which would be 3rd level), Restoration will bring his XP back up to 6000, the minimum amount needed for 4th level characters.    Restoration cures all temporary ability damage, and it restores all points permanently drained from a single ability score (your choice if more than one is drained).  It also eliminates any ~fatigue~[TAG_FATIGUED] or ~exhaustion~[TAG_EXHAUSTED] suffered by the target.  Restoration does not restore levels or ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION] points lost due to ~death~[TAG_DEAD].  Material Component: Diamond dust worth 100 gp that is sprinkled over the target.

In the game, there is no visual representation of this increase, but your character will perform accordingly.  This increase changes your size category to the next larger one, and you gain a +8 size bonus to ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] and a +4 size bonus to ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION].  You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to your natural armor.  You gain damage reduction 5/ unholy (if you normally channel positive energy) or damage reduction 5/ holy (if you normally channel negative energy).  Your size modifier for AC and attacks changes as appropriate to your new size category (if your original size was Diminutive, Tiny, Small, Medium, or Large, the  modifier decreases by 1).  This spell does not change your speed.  All equipment you wear or carry is similarly enlarged by the spell.  Melee and projectile weapons deal more damage.  Other magical properties are not affected by this spell.  Any enlarged item that leaves your possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size.  This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage (projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them).  Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack, which means (among other things) that you can't use a second casting of this spell to further increase your size while you are still under the effect of the first casting.

If the save succeeds, the opponent can attack normally and is unaffected by the casting of that spell.  If the save fails, the opponent can't follow through with the attack, that part of its action is lost, and it can't directly attack the warded creature for the duration of the spell.  Those not attempting to attack the subject remain unaffected.  This spell does not prevent the warded creature from being attacked or affected by area of effect spells.  The subject cannot attack without breaking the spell but may use nonattack spells or otherwise act.  This allows a warded cleric to heal wounds, for example, or to cast a ~Bless~[TAG_SPELLS_BLESS] spell, summon creatures, and so on.

All sound is stopped: conversation is impossible, spells with verbal components cannot be cast, and no noise whatsoever issues from, enters, or passes through the area.    In ToEE, there are 2 potential target areas focused on when casting Silence.  The first is the general area of silence--a space is rendered silent and the silence stays only in that area.  The second target could be a creature, and Silence actually moves with them, rather than staying solely in one area.  The creature then cannot simply move away from Silence.   An unwilling creature can attempt a Will save to negate the spell and can use spell resistance, if any.  Items in a creature's possession or magic items that emit sound receive the benefits of saves and spell resistance, but unattended objects and points in space do not.  This spell provides a defense against sonic or language-based attacks, such as ~Command~[TAG_SPELLS_COMMAND], harpy song, and the like.

Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first.  Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first.  Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted.  For example, Mialee casts Sleep at 3 kobolds (1/2 HD), 2 gnolls (2 HD), and an ogre (4 HD).  All three kobolds and one gnoll are affected:                                (1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 2 = 3 1/2 HD)  The remained 1/2 HD is not enough to affect the last gnoll or the ogre.  Mialee can't choose to have Sleep affect the ogre or the two gnolls.  Sleeping creatures are helpless.  Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not.  Awakening a creature is a ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION].  Sleep does not affect unconscious creatures, constructs, or undead creatures.

Wet earth becomes thick mud, dry earth becomes loose sand or dirt, and stone becomes soft clay.  You affect a 10-foot-square area to a depth of 1 to 4 feet, depending on the toughness or resilience of the ground at that spot.  Magical, enchanted, dressed, or worked stone cannot be affected.  Earth or stone creatures are not affected.  A creature in mud must succeed on ~Reflex~[TAG_REFLEX] save or be caught for 1d2 rounds and unable to move, attack, or cast spells.

In areas of bare earth, roots and rootlets act in the same way.  Spike Growth can only be cast outdoors.  Any creature moving on foot into or through the spell's area of effect takes 1d4 points of piercing damage for every 5 feet of movement through the spiked area.    Any creature that takes damage from this spell must also succeed on a Reflex save or suffer injuries to its feet and legs that slow its land speed by one-half.  This speed penalty lasts for 24 hours or until the injured creature receives a Cure spell (which also restores hit points).  Another character can remove the penalty by taking 10 minutes to dress the injuries and succeeding on a ~Heal~[TAG_HEAL] check against the spell's save DC.

A failed save causes the creature's speed to be reduced to half normal for 24 hours or until the injured creature receives a Cure spell.

The weapon takes the shape of a weapon with some spiritual significance or symbolism to you and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form.  It strikes the opponent as you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn.  It uses your base attack bonus plus your ~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM] modifier as its attack bonus.  It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so, for example, it can damage creatures that have damage reduction.  The weapon always strikes from your direction.  It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one.  Your feats (such as ~Weapon Focus~[TAG_WEAPON_FOCUS]) or combat actions (such as ~charge~[TAG_CHARGE]) do not affect the weapon.  If the weapon goes beyond  the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers.  The spiritual weapon is capable of multiple attacks, provided that your base attack bonus allows you to do so.  The spiritual weapon is a ranged weapon.  It cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks; only ~Dispel Magic~[TAG_SPELLS_DISPEL_MAGIC] is capable of harming the spiritual weapon.  A spiritual weapon's AC against touch attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object).  If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance every time the spiritual weapon attacks.    The weapon that you get may be a force replica of your deity's own personal weapon, many of which have individual names.  The weapons for each deity are listed in the entries for those gods.  For example, the weapon of ~Moradin~[TAG_MORADIN] is noted as being a warhammer, aptly named "Soulhammer".

Living creatures in the cloud become ~nauseated~[TAG_NAUSEATED].  This condition lasts as long as the creature is in the cloud and for 1d4 + 1 rounds after it leaves.

The subject gains damage reduction 10/adamantine.  (It ignores the first 10 points of damage each time it takes damage from a weapon, though an adamantine weapon bypasses the reduction).  Once the spell has prevented a total of 10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 100 points), it is discharged.  Material Component: Granite and 250 gp worth of diamond dust sprinkled on the target's skin.

The power takes the form of a cold, cloying miasma of greasy darkness.  Only good or neutral (not evil) creatures are harmed by the spell.  The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to a good creature (or 1d6 per caster level, maximum 10d6, to a good outsider) and causes it to be ~sickened~[TAG_SICKENED] for 1d4 rounds.  A successful Will save reduces damage to half and negates the sickened effect.  The effects cannot be negated by ~Remove Disease~[TAG_SPELLS_REMOVE_DISEASE]  or ~Heal~[TAG_HEAL], but ~Remove Curse~[TAG_SPELLS_REMOVE_CURSE] is effective.  The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither evil nor good, and they are not sickened.  Such a creature can reduce the damage in half again (down to one-quarter) with a successful Will save.

These strands trap those caught in them.  The strands are similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher.  When casting the spell in ToEE, choose an area (20-ft.-radius) and the web will engulf that area.  Creatures caught within a web or simply touching its strands become entangled among the gluey fibers.    Anyone in the effect's area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save.  If this save succeeds, the creature is not stuck in the web and is free to act, though moving may be a problem.  If the save fails, the creature is stuck.  A stuck creature can break loose by spending 1 round and making a DC 20 ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] check.  Once loose (either by making the initial Reflex save or a later Strength check), a creature may progress through the web very slowly.  Each round devoted to moving allows the creature to make a new Strength check.  The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 10.  If you have at least 5 feet of web between you and an opponent, it provides cover.

It is 2 feet thick and of considerable strength.  It is a roaring blast sufficient to blow away any bird smaller than an eagle or tear light materials from unsuspecting hands.  (A ~Reflex~[TAG_REFLEX] save allows a creature to maintain its grasp on an object).  Arrows and bolts are deflected upward and miss, while any other normal ranged weapon passing through the wall has a 30% miss chance.  In ToEE, the radius of Wind Wall is 3 feet / level (maximum 30 feet).
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARBARIAN_WEAPON_ARMOR_PROF	TAG_BARBARIANS			Weapon and Armor Proficiency	A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARBARIAN_FAST_MOVEMENT	TAG_BARBARIANS			Fast Movement	A barbarian's land speed is faster than the norm for his race by +10 feet.  This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load.  Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any load carried or armor worn.     For example, a ~human~[TAG_HUMANS] barbarian has a speed of 40 feet, rather than 30 feet, when wearing light or no armor.  When wearing medium armor or carrying a medium load, his speed drops to 30 feet.       A ~halfling~[TAG_HALFLINGS] barbarian has a speed of 30 feet, rather than 20 feet, in light or no armor.  When wearing medium armor or carrying a medium load, his speed drops to 20 feet.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARBARIAN_RAGE	TAG_BARBARIANS			Rage	A barbarian can fly into a screaming blood frenzy a certain number of times per day.  In rage, a barbarian gains phenomenal strength and durability but becomes reckless and less able to defend himself.  He temporarily gains a +4 bonus to ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH], a +4 bonus to ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION], and a +2 morale bonus on ~Will~[TAG_WILL] saves, but he takes a -2 to AC.     The Constitution bonus increases the barbarian's hit points by 2 points per level, but these hit points disappear once the rage ends, at which point his Constitution score drops back to normal.       While raging, a barbarian cannot use skills or abilities that require patience or concentration (such as casting a spell or moving silently).  He can use any feat he may have except for ~Combat Expertise~[TAG_COMBAT_EXPERTISE], item creation feats, metamagic feats, and ~Skill Focus~[TAG_SKILL_FOCUS].     A fit of rage lasts for the number of rounds equal to 3 + the character's newly improved Constitution modifier.  At the end of the rage, the barbarian loses the rage modifiers and becomes fatigued (-2 penalty to Strength, -2 penalty to ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY], cannot charge or run) for the same number of rounds as the rage lasted.     A barbarian can fly into a fit of rage only once per encounter.  At 1st level, he can use his rage ability once per day.  At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, he can use it one additional time per day.  Entering a rage can only be done during the barbarian's action, not in response to someone else's action.  For example, a barbarian can't fly into a rage when struck by an arrow just to get the extra hit points from the Constitution bonus.  Those extra hit points would only be helpful if the barbarian initiated a rage before being struck.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARBARIAN_UNCANNY_DODGE	TAG_BARBARIANS			Uncanny Dodge	At 2nd level, a barbarian gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so.  He retains his ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] bonus to ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS] (if any) even if he is caught ~flat-footed~[TAG_FLAT_FOOTED] or struck by an invisible attacker.  However, he still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.     
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_BARDIC_KNOWLEDGE	TAG_BARDS			Bardic Knowledge	A bard picks up a lot of stray knowledge while wandering the land and learning stories from other bards.  He may make a special bardic knowledge check with a bonus equal to his bard level + his ~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE] modifier to see whether he knows some relevant information about local notable people, legendary items, or noteworthy places.       A successful bardic knowledge check will not reveal the powers of a magic item but may give a hint as to its general function.  
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_WEAPON_ARMOR_PROF	TAG_BARDS			Weapon and Armor Proficiency	A bard is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, short sword, and shortbow..  Bards are proficient with light armor, medium armor, and shields.     Because the somatic components required for bard spells are relatively simple, a bard can cast spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal ~arcane spell~[TAG_ARCANE_SPELLS] failure chance.  However, like any other arcane spellcaster, a bard wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component (most do).  A ~multiclass~[TAG_MULTICLASS] bard still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes.[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_BARDIC_MUSIC	TAG_BARDS			Bardic Music	Once per day per bard level, a bard can use her song or poetics to produce magical effects on those around her (including herself, if desired).  While these abilities fall under the category of bardic music and include descriptions of singing or playing instruments, they can all also be activated by reciting poetry, chanting, singing lyrics or melodies, etc.  Each ability requires both a minimum bard level and a minimum number of ranks in the ~Perform~[TAG_PERFORM] skill to qualify.       Starting a bardic music effect is a ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION].  Some bardic music abilities require concentration, which means the bard must take a standard action each round to maintain the ability.  While using bardic music, a bard can fight but cannot cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such as scrolls), or activate magic items by magic word (such as wands).  All are mind-affecting abilities.See ~Countersong~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_COUNTERSONG], ~Fascinate~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_FASCINATE], ~Inspire Courage~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_INSPIRE_COURAGE], ~Intimidate~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_INTIMIDATE], ~Inspire Competence~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_INSPIRE_COMPETENCE], and ~Inspire Greatness~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_INSPIRE_GREATNESS] for descriptions of the different types of bardic musical abilities.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_CLERIC_SPONTANEOUS_CASTING	TAG_CLERICS			Spontaneous Casting	A good cleric (or a neutral cleric of a good deity) can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that the cleric did not prepare ahead of time.  The cleric can "lose" any prepared spell that is not a domain spell in order to cast any Cure spell of the same spell level or lower.  For example, a good cleric who has prepared ~Command~[TAG_SPELLS_COMMAND] (a 1st-level spell) may lose Command in order to cast ~Cure Light Wounds~[TAG_SPELLS_CURE_LIGHT_WOUNDS] (also a 1st-level spell).  Clerics of good deities can cast Cure spells in this way because they are especially proficient at wielding positive energy.     An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric of an evil deity), on the other hand, can't convert prepared spells to Cure spells but can convert them to Inflict spells (for example, ~Inflict Light Wounds~[TAG_SPELLS_INFLICT_LIGHT_WOUNDS].  Such clerics are especially proficient at wielding negative energy.     A cleric who is neither good nor evil and whose deity is neither good nor evil can convert spells to either Cure spells or Inflict spells (player's choice), depending on whether the cleric is more proficient at wielding positive or negative energy.  Once the player makes this choice, it cannot be reversed.  This choice also determines whether the cleric turns or commands undead.       Exceptions: All lawful neutral clerics of ~Wee Jas~[TAG_WEE_JAS] (goddess of death and magic) convert prepared spells to Inflict spells, not Cure spells.  All clerics of ~St. Cuthbert~[TAG_CUTHBERT] (god of retribution) and all nonevil clerics of ~Obad-Hai~[TAG_OBAD_HAI] (god of nature) convert prepared spells to Cure spells, not Inflict spells.To use spontaneous casting in the game, hold down the Shift key and select the spell you would like to cast. 
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_CLERIC_WEAPON_ARMOR_PROF	TAG_CLERICS			Weapon and Armor Proficiency	Clerics are proficient with all simple weapons, with all types of armor (light, medium, and heavy), and with shields.     Every deity has a favored weapon, and his or her clerics consider it a point of pride to wield that weapon.  A cleric who chooses the ~War domain~[TAG_WAR_D] receives the ~Weapon Focus~[TAG_WEAPON_FOCUS] feat related to that weapon as a bonus feat.  He also receives the appropriate ~Martial Weapon Proficiency~[TAG_MARTIAL_PROF] feat as a bonus feat, if the weapon falls into that category.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_CLERIC_DEITY_DOMAINS_AND_DOMAIN_SPELLS	TAG_CLERICS			Deity, Domains, and Domain Spells	Choose a deity for your cleric.  The cleric's deity influences his alignment, what magic he can perform, his values, and how others see him.       If the typical worshipers of a deity include the members of a specific race, a cleric must be of the indicated race to choose that deity as his own.  (The god may have occasional worshipers of other races, but not clerics).     When you have chosen an alignment and a deity for your cleric, choose two domains for the deity.  While the clerics of a particular religion are united in their reverence for their deity, each cleric emphasizes different aspects of the deity's interests.  You can select an alignment domain (~Chaos~[TAG_CHAOS_D], ~Evil~[TAG_EVIL_D], ~Good~[TAG_GOOD_DOMAIN], or ~Law~[TAG_LAW_D]) for your cleric only if his alignment matches that domain.     Each domain gives your cleric access to a domain spell at each spell level he can cast, from 1st on up, as well as a granted power.  Your cleric gets the granted powers of both the domains selected.  With access to two domain spells at a given spell level, a cleric prepares one or the other each day in his domain spell slot.  If a domain spell is not on the cleric spell list, a cleric can prepare it only in his domain spell slot.  Domain spells and granted powers are given in ~Cleric Domains~[TAG_DOMAINS].  
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_CLERIC_TURN_REBUKE_UNDEAD	TAG_CLERICS			Turn or Rebuke Undead	Any cleric, regardless of alignment, has the power to affect undead creatures (such as skeletons, zombies, ghosts, and vampires) by channeling the power of her faith through her holy (or unholy) symbol.     A good cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships a good deity) can turn or destroy undead creatures.  An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships an evil deity) instead rebukes or commands such creatures, forcing them to cower in awe of her power.  If your character is a neutral cleric of a neutral deity, you must choose whether her turning ability functions as that of a good cleric or an evil cleric.  Once you make this choice, it cannot be reversed.  This decision also determines whether the cleric can cast spontaneous Cure or Inflict spells.     Exceptions: All lawful neutral clerics of ~Wee Jas~[TAG_WEE_JAS] rebuke or command undead.  All clerics of St. ~Cuthbert~[TAG_CUTHBERT] and all nonevil clerics of ~Obad-Hai~[TAG_OBAD_HAI] turn or destroy undead.     A cleric may attempt to turn undead a number of times per day equal to 3 + her ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA] modifier.  
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_DRUID_WEAPON_ARMOR_PROF	TAG_DRUIDS			Weapon and Armor Proficiency	Druids are proficient with the following weapons: ~club~[TAG_WEAPONS_CLUB], ~dagger~[TAG_WEAPONS_DAGGER], ~dart~[TAG_WEAPONS_DART], ~quarterstaff~[TAG_WEAPONS_QUARTERSTAFF], ~scimitar~[TAG_WEAPONS_SCIMITAR], ~shortspear~[TAG_WEAPONS_SHORTSPEAR], ~sling~[TAG_WEAPONS_SLING], and ~spear~[TAG_WEAPONS_SPEAR].  They are also proficient with natural attacks (~unarmed strike~[TAG_WEAPONS_STRIKE_UNARMED], claw, bite, etc.), regardless of the forms they assume.  Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but may only wear padded, leather, or hide armor (no metal armor).  They are proficient with shields but must use only wooden ones.     Druids are unable to wear prohibited armor or use a prohibited shield.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_DRUID_ANIMAL_COMPANION	TAG_DRUIDS			Animal Companion	A druid may begin play with an animal companion selected from the following list: dire rat, dog, chicken, lizard, jackal, brown bear, polar bear, panda bear, or wolf. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures as appropriate for its species.       A druid of 4th level or higher may select from alternate lists of animals.  Should she select an animal companion from one of these alternate lists, the creature gains abilities as if the character's druid level were lower than it actually is.  
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_DRUID_NATURE_SENSE	TAG_DRUIDS			Nature Sense	A druid gains a +2 bonus on ~Survival~[TAG_SURVIVAL] checks.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_DRUID_RESIST_NATURES_LURE	TAG_DRUIDS			Resist Nature's Lure	Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on ~saving throws~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] against the spell-like abilities of fey (such as dryads, nymphs, and sprites).
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_DRUID_TRACKLESS_STEP	TAG_DRUIDS			Trackless Step	Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked.  She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_DRUID_VENOM_IMMUNITY	TAG_DRUIDS			Venom Immunity	At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_DRUID_WILD_SHAPE	TAG_DRUIDS			Wild Shape	At 5th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into a Wolf,Brown Bear, or Polar Bear and back again once per day. The effects last for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back.  Changing form (to animal or back) is a ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION] and doesn't provoke an ~attack of opportunity~[TAG_AOO].  The form chosen must be that of an animal the druid is familiar with.  For example, a druid who has never been outside a temperate forest could not become a polar bear.  A druid loses her ability to speak while in an animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form.   A druid can use this ability more times per day at 6th, 7th, and 10th levels.  In addition, she gains the ability to take the shape of a Large animal at 8th level.  However, the new form's Hit Dice can't exceed the character's druid level.  For example at 8th level, a druid can't assume the form of a dire bear, because although it is a Large animal, it has at least 12 Hit Dice.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_FIGHTER_WEAPON_ARMOR_PROF	TAG_FIGHTERS			Weapon and Armor Proficiency	A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, medium, and light) and shields.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_EVASION	TAG_MONKS			Evasion	A monk of 2nd level and higher can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility.  If she makes a successful ~Reflex~[TAG_REFLEX] saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save (such as a ~Fireball~[TAG_SPELLS_FIREBALL]), she instead takes no damage.  Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor.  A ~helpless~[TAG_HELPLESS] monk (such as the one who is unconscious or paralyzed) does not gain the benefit of evasion.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_FAST_MOVEMENT	TAG_MONKS			Fast Movement	At 3rd level and higher, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to her speed.  A monk in armor (even light armor) or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_FLURRY_OF_BLOWS	TAG_MONKS			Flurry of Blows	When unarmored, a monk may strike with a flurry of blows at the expense of accuracy.  When doing so, she may make one extra attack in a round at her highest base attack bonus, but this attack takes a -2 penalty, as does each other attack made that round.  This penalty applies for 1 round, so it also affect ~attacks of opportunity~[TAG_AOO] the monk might make before her next action.  When a monk reaches 5th level, the penalty lessens to -1, and at 9th level it disappears entirely.  A monk must use a full attack action to strike with a flurry of blows.     When using flurry of blows, a monk may attack only with ~unarmed strikes~[TAG_WEAPONS_STRIKE_UNARMED] or with special monk weapons (~kama~[TAG_WEAPONS_KAMA], ~quarterstaff~[TAG_WEAPONS_QUARTERSTAFF], ~sai~[TAG_WEAPONS_SAI], ~shuriken~[TAG_WEAPONS_SHURIKEN], and ~siangham~[TAG_WEAPONS_SIANGHAM]).  She may attack with unarmed strikes and special monk weapons interchangeably as desired.       For example, at 6th level, the monk Ember could make one attack with her unarmed strike at an attack bonus of +3 and one attack with a special monk weapon at an attack bonus of +3.       When using weapons as a part of a flurry of blows, a monk applies her ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] bonus to her damage rolls for all successful attacks, whether she wields a weapon in one or both hands.  The monk can't use any weapon other than a special monk weapon as part of a flurry of blows.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_IMPROVED_EVASION	TAG_MONKS			Improved Evasion	At 9th level, a monk's evasion ability improves.  She still takes no damage on a successful ~Reflex~[TAG_REFLEX] saving throw against attacks such as a ~Fireball~[TAG_SPELLS_FIREBALL], but henceforth she takes only half damage on a failed save.  A ~helpless~[TAG_HELPLESS] monk (such as one who is unconscious or paralyzed) does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_KI_STRIKE	TAG_MONKS			Ki Strike	At 4th level, a monk's unarmed attacks are empowered with ki.  Her unarmed attacks are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction.  Ki strike improves with the character's monk level.  At 10th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with ~damage reduction~[TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES_DAMAGE_REDUCTION].
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_PURITY_OF_BODY	TAG_MONKS			Purity of Body	At 5th level, a monk gains control over her body's immune system.  She gains immunity to all diseases except for supernatural and magical diseases.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_SLOW_FALL	TAG_MONKS			Slow Fall	At 4th level and higher, a monk within arm's reach of a wall can use it to slow her descent.  When first using this ability, she takes damage as if the fall were 20 feet shorter than it actually is.  The monk's ability to slow her fall (that is, reduce the effective distance of the fall when next to a wall) improves with her monk level.  
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_STILL_MIND	TAG_MONKS			Still Mind	A monk of 3rd level and higher gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells and effects from the ~Enchantment~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_ENCHANTMENT] school, since her meditation and training improve her resistance to mind-affecting attacks.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_UNARMED_STRIKE	TAG_MONKS			Unarmed Strike	Monks are highly trained in fighting unarmed, giving them considerable advantages when doing so.  At 1st level, a monk gains ~Improved Unarmed Strike~[TAG_IMPROVED_UNARMED] as a bonus feat.  A monk's attacks may be with either fist interchangeably or even from elbows, knees, and feet.  This means that a monk may even make unarmed strikes with her hands full.  There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed.  A monk may thus apply her full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.     Usually a monk's unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal ~nonlethal damage~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_NONLETHAL_DAMAGE] instead with no penalty on her attack roll.  She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.       A monk's unarmed strike is treated both as a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purposes of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons (such as the ~Magic Fang~[TAG_SPELLS_MAGIC_FANG] and ~Magic Weapon~[TAG_SPELLS_MAGIC_WEAPON] spells).
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_WHOLENESS_OF_BODY	TAG_MONKS			Wholeness of Body	At 7th level or higher, a monk can heal her own wounds.  She can heal a number of hit points of damage equal to twice her current monk level each day, and she can spread this healing out among several uses.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_WEAPON_ARMOR_PROF	TAG_MONKS			Weapon and Armor Proficiency	Monks are proficient with certain basic peasant weapons and some special weapons that are part of monk training.  The weapons with which a monk is proficient are ~club~[TAG_WEAPONS_CLUB], crossbow (~light~[TAG_WEAPONS_CROSSBOW_LIGHT] or ~heavy~[TAG_WEAPONS_CROSSBOW_HEAVY]), ~dagger~[TAG_WEAPONS_DAGGER], ~handaxe~[TAG_WEAPONS_HANDAXE], ~javelin~[TAG_WEAPONS_JAVELIN], ~kama~[TAG_WEAPONS_KAMA], ~quarterstaff~[TAG_WEAPONS_QUARTERSTAFF], ~sai~[TAG_WEAPONS_SAI], ~shuriken~[TAG_WEAPONS_SHURIKEN], ~siangham~[TAG_WEAPONS_SIANGHAM], and ~sling~[TAG_WEAPONS_SLING].  Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields--in fact, many of the monk's special powers require unfettered movement.  When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses her AC bonus, as well as her ~Fast Movement~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_FAST_MOVEMENT] and ~Flurry Of Blows~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_FLURRY_OF_BLOWS] abilities. 
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_PALADIN_AURA_OF_COURAGE	TAG_PALADINS			Aura of Courage	Beginning at 3rd level, a paladin is immune to fear (magical or otherwise).  Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects.  This ability functions while the paladin is conscious, but not if she is ~unconscious~[TAG_UNCONSCIOUS] or ~dead~[TAG_DEAD].
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_PALADIN_DETECT_EVIL	TAG_PALADINS			Detect Evil	At will, a paladin can use the spell ~Detect Evil~[TAG_SPELLS_DETECT_EVIL].  
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_PALADIN_DIVINE_GRACE	TAG_PALADINS			Divine Grace	At 2nd level, a paladin gains a bonus equal to her ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA] bonus (if any) on all saving throws.  
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_PALADIN_DIVINE_HEALTH	TAG_PALADINS			Divine Health	At 3rd level, a paladin gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_PALADIN_LAY_ON_HANDS	TAG_PALADINS			Lay On Hands	Beginning at 2nd level, a paladin with a ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA] score of 12 or higher can heal wounds (her own or those of others) by touch.  Each day she can heal a total number of hit points of damage equal to her paladin level x her Charisma bonus.  For example, a 7th-level paladin with a 16 Charisma (+3 bonus) can heal 21 points of damage per day.  A paladin may choose to divide her healing among multiple recipients, and she doesn't have to use it all at once.  Using lay on hands is a ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION].     Alternatively, a paladin can use any or all of this healing power to deal damage to undead creatures.  Using lay on hands in this way requires a successful melee touch attack and doesn't provide an ~attack of opportunity~[TAG_AOO].  The paladin decides how many of her daily allotment of points to use as damage after successfully touching an undead creature.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_PALADIN_REMOVE_DISEASE	TAG_PALADINS			Remove Disease	At 6th level, a paladin can produce a ~Remove Disease~[TAG_SPELLS_REMOVE_DISEASE] effect, as the spell, once per week.  She can use this ability one additional time per week for every three levels after 6th (twice per week at 9th).
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_PALADIN_SMITE_EVIL	TAG_PALADINS			Smite Evil	Once per day a paladin may attempt to smite evil with one normal melee attack.  She adds her ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA] bonus (if any) to her attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per paladin level.  If the paladin accidentally smites a creature that is not evil, the smite has no effect, but the ability is still used up for that day.     At 5th level and 10th level, the paladin may smite evil one additional time per day.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_PALADIN_TURN_UNDEAD	TAG_PALADINS			Turn Undead	When a paladin reaches 4th level, she gains the supernatural ability to turn undead.  She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA] modifier.  She turns undead as a cleric of three levels lower would.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_PALADIN_WEAPON_ARMOR_PROF	TAG_PALADINS			Weapon and Armor Proficiency	Paladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light) and with shields.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_RANGER_FAVORED_ENEMY	TAG_RANGERS			Favored Enemy	At 1st level, a ranger may select a type of creature to act as his favorite enemy.  Due to his extensive study of his chosen type of foe and training in the proper techniques for combating such creatures, the ranger gains a +2 bonus on ~Bluff~[TAG_BLUFF], ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN], ~Sense Motive~[TAG_SENSE_MOTIVE], ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT], and ~Survival~[TAG_SURVIVAL] checks when using these skills against creatures of this type.  Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against such creatures.     At 5th level and 10th level, the ranger may select an additional favored enemy.  In addition, at each interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by 2.  For example, a 5th-level ranger has two favored enemies; against one he gains a +4 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks and weapon damage rolls, and against the other he has a +2 bonus.  At 10th level, he has three favored enemies, and he gains an additional +2 bonus, which he can allocate to the bonus against any one of his three favored enemies.  Thus, his bonuses could be either +4, +4, +2, or +6, +2, +2.     If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype.  If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy (for instance, devils are both outsiders and lawful outsiders), the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.  
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_RANGER_IMPROVED_COMBAT_STYLE	TAG_RANGERS			Improved Combat Style	At 6th level, a ranger's aptitude in a chosen combat style (archery or two-weapon combat) improves. If he selected archery at 2nd level, he is treated as having the ~Manyshot~[TAG_MANYSHOT] feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.    If the ranger selected two-weapon combat at 2nd level, he is treated as having the ~Improved Two-Weapon Fighting~[TAG_IMPROVED_TWO_WEAPON_FIGHTING] feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.       As before, the benefits of the ranger's combat style apply only when he wears light or no armor.  He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.  
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_RANGER_TRACK	TAG_RANGERS			Track	A ranger gains ~Track~[TAG_TRACK] as a bonus feat.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_RANGER_WEAPON_ARMOR_PROF	TAG_RANGERS			Weapon and Armor Proficiency	A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with light armor and shields.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_CRIPPLING_STRIKE	TAG_ROGUES			Crippling Strike	On attaining 10th level, a rogue gains a special ability of her choice from among Crippling Strike, ~Defensive Roll~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_DEFENSIVE_ROLL], ~Improved Evasion~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_IMPROVED_EVASION], ~Opportunist~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_OPPORTUNIST], ~Skill Mastery~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_SKILL_MASTERY], and ~Slippery Mind~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_SLIPPERY_MIND].  The following describes Crippling Strike.     A rogue with this ability can sneak attack opponents with such precision that her blows weaken and hamper them.  An opponent damaged by one of her sneak attacks also takes 2 points of ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] damage.  Ability points lost to damage return on their own at the rate of 1 point per day for each damaged ability.                         
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_WEAPON_ARMOR_PROF	TAG_ROGUES			Weapon and Armor Proficiency	Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the ~rapier~[TAG_WEAPONS_RAPIER], ~shortbow~[TAG_WEAPONS_SHORTBOW], and ~short sword~[TAG_WEAPONS_SWORD_SHORT].  Rogues are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_SNEAK_ATTACK	TAG_ROGUES			Sneak Attack	If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.  Basically, the rogue's attack deals extra damage any time her target would be denied a ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] bonus to ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS] (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target.  This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and it increases by 1d6 every two rogue levels thereafter.  Should the rogue score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied.     Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.  A rogue can't strike with deadly accuracy from beyond that range.  With a ~sap~[TAG_WEAPONS_SAP] (blackjack) or an ~unarmed strike~[TAG_WEAPONS_STRIKE_UNARMED], a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals ~nonlethal damage~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_NONLETHAL_DAMAGE] instead of lethal damage.  She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual -4 penalty, because she must make optimal use of her weapon in order to execute a sneak attack.     A rogue can sneak attack only living creatures with discernible anatomies--undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack.  Any creature that is immune to critical hits is not vulnerable to sneak attacks.  The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot.  A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment or striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_TRAPS	TAG_ROGUES			Traps	Trapfinding: Rogues (and only rogues) can use the ~Search~[TAG_SEARCH] skill to locate traps when the task has a Difficulty Class higher than 20.  Finding a nonmagical trap has a DC of at least 20, or higher if it is well hidden.  Finding a magic trap has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it.     Rogues (and only rogues) can use the ~Disable Device~[TAG_DISABLE_DEVICE] skill to disarm magic traps.  A magic trap generally has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it.     A rogue who beats a trap's DC by 10 or more with a Disable Device check can study a trap, figure out how it works, and bypass it (with her party) without disarming it.Trap Sense: At 3rd level, a rogue gains an intuitive sense that alerts her to danger from traps, giving her a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps.  These bonuses rise to +2 when the rogue reaches 6th level, and to +3 when she reaches 9th level.  Trap bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_UNCANNY_DODGE	TAG_ROGUES			Uncanny Dodge	Starting at 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so.  She retains her ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] bonus to ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS] (if any) even if she is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker.  However, she still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_SORCERER_CALL_FAMILIAR	TAG_SORCERERS			Call Familiar	A sorcerer can obtain a familiar.  Doing so takes 24 hours and uses up magical materials that cost 100 gp.  A familiar is a magical beast that resembles a small animal and is unusually tough and intelligent.  The creature serves as a companion and a servant.     The sorcerer chooses the kind of familiar he gets.  As the sorcerer advances in level, his familiar also increases in power.     If the familiar dies or is dismissed by the sorcerer, the sorcerer must attempt a DC 15 ~Fortitude~[TAG_FORTITUDE] saving throw.  Failure means he loses 200 experience points per sorcerer level; success reduces the loss to one-half that amount.  However, a sorcerer's experience point total can never go below 0 as the result of a familiar's demise or dismissal.  A slain or dismissed familiar can be raised from the dead just as a character can be, and it does not lose a level or ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION] point when this happy event occurs.       A character with more than one class that grants a familiar may have only one familiar at a time.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_WIZARD_CALL_FAMILIAR	TAG_WIZARDS			Call Familiar	A wizard can call a familiar. Doing so takes a day and uses up magical materials that cost 100 gp. A familiar is a magical, unusually tough and intelligent version of a small animal. It is a magical beast, not an animal. The creature serves as a companion and servant.  The wizard chooses the type of familiar he gets. As the wizard increases in level, his familiar also increases in power.  If the familiar dies, or the wizard chooses to dismiss it, the wizard must attempt a ~Fortitude~[TAG_FORTITUDE] saving throw (DC 15). If the saving throw fails, the wizard loses 200 experience points per class level. A successful saving throw reduces the loss to half of that amount. However, a wizard's experience point total can never go below zero as the result of a familiar's demise.      A slain or dismissed familiar cannot be replaced for a year and day. Slain familiars can be raised from the dead just as characters can be, but do not lose a level or a ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION] point when this happy event occurs.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_SORCERER_WEAPON_ARMOR_PROF	TAG_SORCERERS			Weapon and Armor Proficiency	Sorcerers are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor, nor with shields. Armor of any type interferes with a sorcerer's arcane gestures, which can cause his spells to fail (if those spells have somatic components).
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_WIZARD_WEAPON_ARMOR_PROF	TAG_WIZARDS			Weapon and Armor Proficiency	Wizards are proficient with the club, dagger, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, and quarterstaff. Wizards are not proficient with any type of armor nor with shields. Armor of any type interferes with a wizard's movements, which can cause her spells to fail (if those spells have somatic components).
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_WIZARD_SCRIBE_SCROLL	TAG_WIZARDS			Scribe Scroll	At 1st level, a wizard gains Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat.  This feat enables her to create magic scrolls.
TAG_WEAPONS_ARROWS	TAG_WEAPONS			Arrows	An arrow that hits it target is destroyed; one that misses has a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.  They come in a leather quiver that holds 20 arrows.  An arrow is not used as a melee weapon in ToEE.
TAG_WEAPONS_AXE_THROWING	TAG_WEAPONS			Axe, Throwing	A throwing axe is lighter than a handaxe and balanced for throwing.  Gnome fighters often use throwing axes for both melee and ranged attacks.
TAG_WEAPONS_BATTLEAXE	TAG_WEAPONS			Battleaxe	The battleaxe is the most common melee weapon among dwarves.
TAG_WEAPONS_BOLTS	TAG_WEAPONS			Bolts	Crossbow bolts come in a wooden case that holds 10 bolts.  A bolt that hits its target is destroyed; one that misses has a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.  
TAG_WEAPONS_BULLETS_SLING	TAG_WEAPONS			Bullets, Sling	Bullets are lead spheres, much heavier than stones of the same size.  They come in a leather pouch that holds 10 bullets.  A bullet that hits its target is destroyed; one that misses has a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.
TAG_WEAPONS_CROSSBOW_HEAVY	TAG_WEAPONS			Crossbow, Heavy	You draw a heavy crossbow by turning a small winch.  Loading a heavy crossbow is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.     Normally, operating a heavy crossbow requires two hands.  However, you can shoot, but not load, a heavy crossbow with one hand at a -4 penalty on attack rolls.  You can shoot a heavy crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two weapons.  This penalty stacks with the penalty for one-handed firing.
TAG_WEAPONS_CROSSBOW_LIGHT	TAG_WEAPONS			Crossbow, Light	You can draw a light crossbow back by pulling a lever.  Loading a light crossbow is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity.       Normally, operating a light crossbow requires two hands.  However, you can shoot, but not load, a light crossbow with one hand at a -2 penalty on attack rolls.  You can shoot a light crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two weapons.  This penalty stacks with the penalty for one-handed firing.  
TAG_WEAPONS_CROSSBOW_REPEATING	TAG_WEAPONS			Crossbow, Repeating	The repeating crossbow (whether heavy or light) holds a clip of multiple bolts.  For game purposes, it never has to be reloaded during combat and functions as a bow.     
TAG_WEAPONS_DAGGER	TAG_WEAPONS			Dagger	The dagger is a common secondary weapon.
TAG_WEAPONS_DART	TAG_WEAPONS			Dart	A dart is the size of a large arrow and has a weighted head.  Essentially, it is a small javelin.
TAG_WEAPONS_FALCHION	TAG_WEAPONS			Falchion	This sword, which is essentially a two-handed scimitar, has a curve that gives it the effect of a keener edge.
TAG_WEAPONS_GLAIVE	TAG_WEAPONS			Glaive	A glaive has reach.  You can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can't use it against an adjacent foe.
TAG_WEAPONS_GREATAXE	TAG_WEAPONS			Greataxe	This big, heavy axe is a favorite of barbarians and anybody else who wants the capacity to deal out incredible damage.
TAG_WEAPONS_GREATCLUB	TAG_WEAPONS			Greatclub	A greatclub is a two-handed version of a regular club.  It is often studded with nails or spikes or ringed by bands of iron.
TAG_WEAPONS_GUISARME	TAG_WEAPONS			Guisarme	A guisarme has reach.  You can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can't use it against an adjacent foe.
TAG_WEAPONS_HALBERD	TAG_WEAPONS			Halberd	Normally, you strike with a halberd's axe head, but the spike on the end is useful against charging opponents.  If you use a ready action to set a halberd against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging character.
TAG_WEAPONS_HAMMER_LIGHT	TAG_WEAPONS			Hammer, Light	This is a small sledge light enough to throw.  It is favored by dwarves.
TAG_WEAPONS_HANDAXE	TAG_WEAPONS			Handaxe	Dwarves favor these axes as off-hand weapons.
TAG_WEAPONS_JAVELIN	TAG_WEAPONS			Javelin	This weapon is a light, flexible spear intended for throwing.  You can use it in melee, but not well.  Since it is not designed for melee, you are treated as nonproficient with it and take a -4 penalty on attack rolls if you use it as a melee weapon.
TAG_WEAPONS_KAMA	TAG_WEAPONS			Kama	The kama is a special monk weapon.  This designation gives a monk wielding a kama special options.
TAG_WEAPONS_LONGBOW	TAG_WEAPONS			Longbow	You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size.  If you have a penalty for low ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH], apply it to damage rolls when you use a longbow.  If you have a bonus for high Strength, you can apply it to damage rolls when you use a composite longbow but not a regular longbow.  
TAG_WEAPONS_LONGBOW_COMPOSITE	TAG_WEAPONS			Longbow, Composite	You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size.  Composite longbows are made from two or more layers of horn, wood, or bone.  All composite bows are made with a particular strength rating (that is, each requires a minimum ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] modifier to use with proficiency).  If your Strength bonus is less than the strength rating of the composite bow, you can't effectively use it, so you take a -2 penalty on attacks with it.  The default composite longbow requires a Strength modifier of +0 or higher to use with proficiency.  A composite longbow can be made with a high strength rating (representing an especially heavy pull) to take advantage of an above-average Strength score; this feature allows you to add your Strength bonus to damage, up to the maximum bonus indicated for the bow.  Each point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds 100 gp to its cost.  For instance, a composite longbow (+1 Str bonus) costs 200 gp, while a composite longbow (+4 Str bonus) costs 500 gp.     For example, Tordek has a +2 Strength bonus.  With a regular composite longbow, he gets no modifier on damage rolls.  For 200 gp, he can buy a composite longbow (+1 Str bonus), which lets him add +1 to his damage rolls.  For 300 gp, he can buy one that lets him add his entire +2 Str bonus.  Even if he paid 400 gp for a composite longbow (+3 Str bonus), he would still get only a +2 bonus on damage rolls and takes a -2 penalty on attacks with it because his Strength is insufficient to use the weapon to best advantage.  The bow can't grant him a higher bonus than he already has.     For purposes of weapon proficiency and similar feats, a composite longbow is treated as if it were a longbow.  Thus, if you have Weapon Focus (longbow), that feat applies both to longbows and composite longbows.
TAG_WEAPONS_LONGSPEAR	TAG_WEAPONS			Longspear	A longspear has reach.  You can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can't use it against an adjacent foe.  If you use a ready action to set a longspear against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging character.  
TAG_WEAPONS_LONGSWORD	TAG_WEAPONS			Longsword	This classic, straight blade is the weapon of knighthood and valor.  It is a favorite weapon of many paladins.
TAG_WEAPONS_MACE_HEAVY_LIGHT	TAG_WEAPONS			Mace, Heavy or Light	A mace is made of metal, even the haft, which makes it quite heavy and hard to break.
TAG_WEAPONS_MORNINGSTAR	TAG_WEAPONS			Morningstar	This simple weapon combines the impact of the club with the piercing force of spikes.
TAG_WEAPONS_PICK_HEAVY_LIGHT	TAG_WEAPONS			Pick, Heavy or Light	A pick is designed to concentrate the force of its blow on a small area.  A light or heavy pick resembles a miner's pick but is specifically designed for war.
TAG_WEAPONS_QUARTERSTAFF	TAG_WEAPONS			Quarterstaff	The quarterstaff is the favorite weapon of many characters, from travelers, peasants, and merchants to monks, rangers, and wizards.  You can strike with either end singly, a fact that allows you to take full advantage of openings in your opponent's defenses.       The quarterstaff is a special monk weapon.  This designation gives a monk wielding a quarterstaff special options.
TAG_WEAPONS_RANSEUR	TAG_WEAPONS			Ranseur	A ranseur has reach.  You can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can't use it on an adjacent foe.     
TAG_WEAPONS_RAPIER	TAG_WEAPONS			Rapier	You can use the ~Weapon Finesse~[TAG_WEAPON_FINESSE] feat to apply your ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] modifier instead of your ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] modifier to attack rolls with a rapier sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon for you.  You can't wield a rapier in two hands in order to apply 1 1/2 times your Strength bonus to damage.  
TAG_WEAPONS_SAI 	TAG_WEAPONS			Sai	The sai is a special monk weapon.  This designation gives a monk wielding a sai special options.
TAG_WEAPONS_SAP	TAG_WEAPONS			Sap	A sap does nonlethal damage, which comes in handy when you want to knock an opponent out instead of killing her.
TAG_WEAPONS_SCIMITAR	TAG_WEAPONS			Scimitar	The curve on this blade gives it the effect of a keener edge.
TAG_WEAPONS_SCYTHE	TAG_WEAPONS			Scythe	While it resembles the standard farm implement of the same name, this scythe is balanced and strengthened for war.  The design of the scythe focuses tremendous force on the sharp point as well as allowing devastating slashes with the blade edge.
TAG_WEAPONS_SHIELD_HEAVY_LIGHT	TAG_WEAPONS			Shield, Heavy or Light	You can use a heavy or light shield for defense only.
TAG_WEAPONS_SHORTBOW	TAG_WEAPONS			Shortbow	You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size.  If you have a penalty for low ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH], apply it to damage rolls when you use a shortbow.  If you have a bonus for high Strength, you can apply it to damage rolls when you use a composite shortbow but not a regular shortbow.
TAG_WEAPONS_SHORTBOW_COMPOSITE	TAG_WEAPONS			Shortbow, Composite	You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size.  Composite bows are made from two or more layers of horn, wood, or bone.  All composite bows are made with a particular strength rating (that is, each requires a minimum ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] modifier to use with proficiency).  If your Strength bonus is lower than the strength rating of the composite bow, you can't effectively use it, so you take a -2 penalty on attacks with it.  The default composite shortbow requires a Strength modifier of +0 or higher to use with proficiency.  A composite shortbow can be made with a high strength rating (representing an especially heavy pull) to take advantage of an above-average Strength score; this feature allows you to add your Strength bonus to damage, up to the maximum bonus granted by the bow. Each bonus to the strength of a shortbow adds 75 gp to its cost.  For instance, a composite shortbow (+1 Str bonus) costs 150 gp, while a composite shortbow (+4 Str bonus) costs 375 gp.     For purposes of weapon proficiency and similar feats, a composite shortbow is treated as if it were a shortbow.  Thus, if you have Weapon Focus (shortbow), that feat applies both to shortbows and composite shortbows.
TAG_WEAPONS_SHORTSPEAR	TAG_WEAPONS			Shortspear	A shortspear is small enough to wield one-handed.  It may also be thrown.
TAG_WEAPONS_SHURIKEN	TAG_WEAPONS			Shuriken	A shuriken is a special monk weapon.  This designation gives a monk wielding a shuriken special options.  A shuriken can't be used as a melee weapon.     Although they are thrown weapons, shuriken are treated as ammunition for the purposes of drawing them, crafting masterwork or otherwise special versions of them, and in regard to what happens to them after they are thrown.
TAG_WEAPONS_SIANGHAM	TAG_WEAPONS			Siangham	The siangham is a special monk weapon.  This designation gives a monk wielding a siangham special options.
TAG_WEAPONS_SLING	TAG_WEAPONS			Sling	A sling hurls lead bullets.  It doesn't shoot as far as a crossbow, nor is it as powerful as a bow, but it's cheap and easy to improvise from common materials.  Druids and halflings favor slings.  Your ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] modifier applies to damage rolls when you use a sling, just as it does for thrown weapons.  You can fire, but not load, a sling with one hand.  Loading a sling is a move action that requires two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity.     You can hurl ordinary stones with a sling, but stones are not as dense or as round as bullets.  Thus, such an attack deals damage as if the weapon were designed for a creature one size category smaller than you (for instance, 1d3 instead of 1d4), and you take a -1 penalty on attack rolls.
TAG_WEAPONS_SPEAR	TAG_WEAPONS			Spear	One of the simplest weapons in existence, the spear is favored by druids and sorcerers.  It can be thrown.  If you use a ready action to set a spear against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging character.
TAG_WEAPONS_STRIKE_UNARMED	TAG_WEAPONS			Strike, Unarmed	A Medium character deals 1d3 points of nonlethal damage with an unarmed strike, which may be a punch, kick, head butt, or other type of attack.  A Small character deals 1d2 points of nonlethal damage.  A monk or any character with the ~Improved Unarmed Strike~[TAG_IMPROVED_UNARMED] feat can deal lethal or nonlethal damage with unarmed strikes, at her option.  The damage from an unarmed strike is considered weapon damage for the purposes of effects that give you a bonus on weapon damage rolls.     An unarmed strike is always considered a light weapon.  Therefore, you can use the ~Weapon Finesse~[TAG_WEAPON_FINESSE] feat to apply your ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] modifier instead of your ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] modifier to attack rolls with an unarmed strike.
TAG_WEAPONS_SWORD_BASTARD	TAG_WEAPONS			Sword, Bastard	Bastard swords are also known as hand-and-a-half swords.  A bastard sword is too large to use in one hand without special training; thus, it is an exotic weapon.  A character can use a bastard sword two-handed as a martial weapon.
TAG_WEAPONS_SWORD_SHORT	TAG_WEAPONS			Sword, Short	This sword is popular as an off-hand weapon.
TAG_WEAPONS_TRIDENT	TAG_WEAPONS			Trident	This three-tined piercing weapon can be thrown just as a shortspear or spear can be, but its range increment is shorter because it's not as aerodynamic as those other weapons.  If you use a ready action to set a trident against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging character.
TAG_WEAPONS_WARAXE_DWARVEN	TAG_WEAPONS			Waraxe, Dwarven	A dwarven waraxe is too large to use in one hand without special training; thus, it is an exotic weapon.  A Medium character can use a dwarven waraxe two-handed as a martial weapon, or a Large creature can use it one-handed in the same way.  A dwarf treats a dwarven waraxe as a martial weapon even when using it in one hand.
TAG_WEAPONS_WARHAMMER	TAG_WEAPONS			Warhammer	This weapon, favored by dwarves, is a one-handed sledge or maul with a large, heavy head.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_DEFENSIVE_ROLL	TAG_ROGUES			Defensive Roll	On attaining 10th level, a rogue gains a special ability of her choice from among ~Crippling Strike~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_CRIPPLING_STRIKE], Defensive Roll, ~Improved Evasion~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_IMPROVED_EVASION], ~Opportunist~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_OPPORTUNIST], ~Skill Mastery~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_SKILL_MASTERY], and ~Slippery Mind~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_SLIPPERY_MIND].   The following describes Defensive Roll.Defensive Roll: The rogue can roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it than she otherwise would.  Once per day, when she would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), the rogue can attempt to roll with the damage.  To use this ability, the rogue must attempt a ~Reflex~[TAG_REFLEX] saving throw. (DC=damage dealt).  If the save succeeds, she takes only half damage from the blow; if it fails, she takes full damage.  She must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to execute her defensive roll--if she is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC, she can't use this ability.  Since this effect would not normally allow a character to make a Reflex save for half damage, the rogue's ~evasion~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_EVASION] ability does not apply to the defensive roll.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_IMPROVED_EVASION	TAG_ROGUES			Improved Evasion	On attaining 10th level, a rogue gains a special ability of her choice from among ~Crippling Strike~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_CRIPPLING_STRIKE], ~Defensive Roll~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_DEFENSIVE_ROLL], Improved Evasion, ~Opportunist~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_OPPORTUNIST], ~Skill Mastery~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_SKILL_MASTERY], and ~Slippery Mind~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_SLIPPERY_MIND].   The following describes Improved Evasion.This ability works like ~evasion~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_EVASION], except that while the rogue still takes no damage on a successful ~Reflex~[TAG_REFLEX] saving throw against attacks such as a dragon's breath weapon or a Fireball, henceforth she takes only half damage on a failed save.  A ~helpless~[TAG_HELPLESS] rogue (such as one who is unconscious or paralyzed) does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_OPPORTUNIST	TAG_ROGUES			Opportunist	On attaining 10th level, a rogue gains a special ability of her choice from among ~Crippling Strike~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_CRIPPLING_STRIKE], ~Defensive Roll~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_DEFENSIVE_ROLL], ~Improved Evasion~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_IMPROVED_EVASION], Opportunist, ~Skill Mastery~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_SKILL_MASTERY], and ~Slippery Mind~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_SLIPPERY_MIND].   The following describes Opportunist.Once per round, the rogue can make an ~attack of opportunity~[TAG_AOO] against an opponent who has just been struck for damage in melee by another character.  This attack counts as the rogue's attack of opportunity for that round.  Even a rogue with the ~Combat Reflexes~[TAG_COMBAT_REFLEXES] feat can't use the opportunist ability more than once per round.  
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_SKILL_MASTERY	TAG_ROGUES			Skill Mastery	On attaining 10th level, a rogue gains a special ability of her choice from among ~Crippling Strike~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_CRIPPLING_STRIKE], ~Defensive Roll~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_DEFENSIVE_ROLL], ~Improved Evasion~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_IMPROVED_EVASION], ~Opportunist~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_OPPORTUNIST], Skill Mastery, and ~Slippery Mind~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_SLIPPERY_MIND].   The following describes Skill Mastery.The rogue becomes so adept in the use of certain skills that she can use them reliably even under adverse conditions.  Upon gaining this ability, she selects a number of skills equal to 3 + her ~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE] modifier.  
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_SLIPPERY_MIND	TAG_ROGUES			Slippery Mind	On attaining 10th level, a rogue gains a special ability of her choice from among ~Crippling Strike~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_CRIPPLING_STRIKE], ~Defensive Roll~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_DEFENSIVE_ROLL], ~Improved Evasion~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_IMPROVED_EVASION], ~Opportunist~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_OPPORTUNIST], ~Skill Mastery~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_SKILL_MASTERY], and Slippery Mind.   The following describes Slippery Mind.     This ability represents the rogue's ability to wriggle free from magical effects that would otherwise control or compel her.  If a rogue with slippery mind is affected by an ~Enchantment~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_ENCHANTMENT] spell or effect and fails her saving throw, she can attempt it again 1 round later at the same DC.  She gets only this one extra chance to succeed on her saving throw.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_COUNTERSONG	TAG_BARDS			Countersong	 A bard with 3 or more ranks in a ~Perform~[TAG_PERFORM] skill can use her music or poetics to counter magical effects that depend on sound (but not spells that simply have verbal components).  The bard may keep up the countersong for 10 rounds.  Each round of the countersong, she makes a Perform check.  Any creature within 30 feet of the bard (including the bard herself) that is affected by a sonic or language-dependent magical attack (such as a ~Sound Burst~[TAG_SPELLS_SOUND_BURST] or ~Command~[TAG_SPELLS_COMMAND] spell) may use the bard's Perform check result in place of its ~saving throw~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] if, after the saving throw is rolled, the Perform check result proves to be higher.  If a creature within range of the countersong is already under the effect of a noninstaneous sonic or language-dependent magical attack, it gains another saving throw against the effect each round it hears the countersong, but it must use the bard's Perform check result for the save.  Countersong will not influence effects that don't allow saves.  
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_FASCINATE	TAG_BARDS			Fascinate	 A bard with 3 or more ranks in a ~Perform~[TAG_PERFORM] skill can use his music or poetics to cause one or more creatures to become ~fascinated~[TAG_FASCINATED].  No other action besides ~movement~[TAG_MOVEMENT_ACTION] can be executed by the bard during the round that the creature is fascinated. Each creature must be within 90 feet and able to see, hear, and pay attention to the bard.  Likewise, the bard must be able to see the creature.  For every three levels beyond 1st, he can target one additional creature with a single use of this ability (e.g. two at 4th level, three at 7th level, etc.).       To fascinate, a bard makes a Perform check.  His check result is the DC for each affected creature's ~Will~[TAG_WILL] save against the effect.  If the creature's saving throw is successful, a bard can still attempt to fascinate the same creature as many times as the bard's daily performance limit allows. If the creature's saving throw fails, it sits and listens to the song for as long as the bard continues to play and concentrate (up to a max of 1 round per bard level).  While fascinated, a target takes a -4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions (e.g. ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN] or ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT] checks).       Any potential threat to the target, such as an ally of the bard approaching the creature, requires the bard to make another Perform check and allows the creature a new saving throw against a DC equal to the new Perform check result.  Any obvious threat to the target,  such as someone drawing a weapon or the creature taking damage, automatically breaks the effect and the creature will no longer be fascinated.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_INSPIRE_COURAGE	TAG_BARDS			Inspire Courage	A bard with 3 or more ranks in a ~Perform~[TAG_PERFORM] skill can use song or poetics to inspire courage in her allies (including herself), bolstering them against fear and improving their combat abilities.  To be affected, an ally must be able to hear the bard sing, and the effect lasts as long as the bard can be heard and for 5 rounds thereafter.  The ally will receive a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls.  At 8th level, this bonus increases by 1.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_INSPIRE_COMPETENCE	TAG_BARDS			Inspire Competence	 A bard of 3rd level or higher with 6 or more ranks in a ~Perform~[TAG_PERFORM] skill can use his music or poetics to help an ally succeed at a task.  A bard cannot inspire competence in himself.  The ally must be within 30 feet and be able to see and hear the bard; likewise, the bard must be able to see the ally.  ~Bardic music~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_BARDIC_MUSIC] may be used to lift the ally's spirits, to help them mentally focus, or in some other manner.  The ally gets a +2 competence bonus on skill checks with a particular skill as long as they continue to hear the bard's music.  The effect lasts as long as the bard concentrates, up to a maximum of 2 minutes.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_INTIMIDATE	TAG_BARDS			Intimidate	A bard of 6th level or higher with 9 or more ranks in a ~Perform~[TAG_PERFORM] skill can cause a single creature to be intimidated while the creature is ~fascinated~[TAG_FASCINATED].  Using this ability does not break the bard's concentration on the fascinate effect, nor does it allow a second saving throw for the target.  The use of Intimidate counts towards a bard's daily limit on performances. The creature is affected if it fails a ~Will~[TAG_WILL] saving throw (DC 11 + bard's ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA] modifier).  If the saving throw fails, affected creatures move away from the bard as if they are victim of a ~Fear~[TAG_SPELLS_FEAR] spell for the number of rounds equal to the number of levels the bard has.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_INSPIRE_GREATNESS	TAG_BARDS			Inspire Greatness	 A bard of 9th level or 10th level with 12 or more ranks in a ~Perform~[TAG_PERFORM] skill can use music or poetics to inspire greatness in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet, granting him or her an extra fighting capability.  To inspire greatness, a bard must sing and be heard by an ally.  The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for 5 rounds thereafter.  A creature inspired with greatness gains 2 bonus Hit Dice (d10s), the commensurate number of ~temporary hit points~[TAG_TEMPORARY_HIT_POINTS] (apply the target's ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION] modifier, if any, to these bonus Hit Dice), a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls, and a +1 competence bonus on ~Fortitude~[TAG_FORTITUDE] saves.  The bonus Hit Dice count as regular Hit Dice for determining the effect of spells such as ~Sleep~[TAG_SPELLS_SLEEP].
TAG_WEAPONS_GREATSWORD	TAG_WEAPONS			Greatsword	Adventurers recognize the greatsword as one of the best melee weapons available.  It's reliable and powerful.
TAG_WEAPONS_CLUB	TAG_WEAPONS			Club	A wooden club is so easy to find and fashion that it has no cost.
TAG_WEAPONS_KUKRI	TAG_WEAPONS			Kukri	This heavy, curved knife has its sharp edge on the inside of the curve.
TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC	TAG_LEVEL_BONUSES			Saving Throws	Generally, when you are subject to an unusual or magical attack, you get a saving throw to avoid or reduce the effect.  Like an attack roll, a saving throw is a d20 roll plus a bonus based on your class, level and ability score.  Your saving throw modifier is:                                Base save bonus + ability modifierThere are three different kinds of saving throws: ~Fortitude~[TAG_FORTITUDE], ~Reflex~[TAG_REFLEX], and ~Will~[TAG_WILL].Saving Throw Difficulty Class: The DC for a save is determined by the attack itself.  For example, a Medium monstrous centipede's poison allows a DC 11 Fortitude save against it.Automatic Failures and Successes: A natural 1 on a saving throw is always a failure.  A natural 20 is always a success.
TAG_CHARGEN_STATS	TAG_CHARGEN			Character Generation: Stats	     The first part of character generation is assigning ability scores to the ~character abilities~[TAG_THE_ABILITIES].  By clicking on the ROLL button, six numbers will be generated by rolling four six-sided dice and eliminating the lowest single die roll. Additionally, scores with ability bonuses that total less than 0 or scores with no number greater than 13 will automatically be rerolled. If you are still unhappy with the outcome, the option is available to reroll as many times as you would like.      You assign the scores to the ability by clicking and dragging the number to the box next to the ability name. Once all are done, you can reassign them, reroll them, or move on to race selection.
TAG_CHARGEN_STATS_POINT_BUY	TAG_CHARGEN_STATS			Character Generation: Stats (Point Buy)	In normal mode, you can choose to buy your ability scores directly. Yourcharacter begins with all abilities at 8. You are given 25 points to spendon raising your abilities. Abilities cost 1 point to raise for each score upto 14, 2 points for scores 15 and 16, and 3 points for scores 17 and 18.Thus the total point cost for each ability score would be:Ability Score Total Point Cost9 110 211 312 413 514 615 816 1017 1318 16Point buying allows you to customize your character's scores, but randomrolling will eventually generate better scores.

TAG_FORTITUDE	TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC			Fortitude	These saves measure your ability to stand up to massive physical punishment or attacks against your vitality and health.  Apply your ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION] modifier to your Fortitude saving throws (1d20 + base save bonus + Constitution modifier).Fortitude saves can be made against attacks or effects such as poison, disease, paralysis, petrification, energy drain, Destruction, and Disintegrate.
TAG_REFLEX	TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC			Reflex	These saves test your ability to dodge area attacks.  Apply your Dexterity modifier to your Reflex saving throws (1d20 + base save bonus + Dexterity modifier).  Reflex saves can be made against attacks or effects such as pit traps, catching on fire, ~Fireball~[TAG_SPELLS_FIREBALL], ~Lightning Bolt~[TAG_SPELLS_LIGHTNING_BOLT], and red dragon breath.
TAG_WILL	TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC			Will	These saves reflect your resistance to mental influence and domination as well as many magical effects.  Apply your ~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM] modifier to your Will saving throws (1d20 + base save bonus + Wisdom modifier).  Will saves can be made against attacks or effects such as ~Charm Person~[TAG_SPELLS_CHARM_PERSON], ~Hold Person~[TAG_SPELLS_HOLD_PERSON], and most illusion spells.
TAG_CHARGEN_GENDER_MALE	TAG_CHARGEN			Character Generation: Gender-Male	You are male.
TAG_CHARGEN_GENDER_FEMALE	TAG_CHARGEN	TAG_GENDER_MALE		Character Generation: Gender-Female	You are female.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_DESC	TAG_LEVEL_BONUSES			Class Features	Class features are special characteristics that belong exclusively to that class.  When applicable, restrictions and disadvantages will also be described.  Class features include aspects such as Weapon and Armor Proficiency, special skills, or spells. 
TAG_FLAT_FOOTED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Flat-Footed	A character who has not yet acted during combat is flat-footed and is especially vulnerable to attacks.  Characters remain flat-footed until their first turn in the initiative cycle.   A flat-footed character loses his ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] bonus to ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS] (if any) and cannot make attacks of opportunity.     Special:  Barbarians and rogues have the ~Uncanny Dodge~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARBARIAN_UNCANNY_DODGE] extraordinary ability, which allows them to avoid losing their AC due to being flat-footed.  
TAG_MELEE_ATTACKS	TAG_COMBAT			Melee Attack	With a normal melee weapon, you can strike any opponent within 5 feet.  (Opponents within 5 feet are considered adjacent to you).  Some melee weapons have reach.  With a typical reach weapon, you can strike opponents 10 feet away, but you can't strike adjacent foes (those within 5 feet).  A melee attack is a standard action.In order to damage your opponent you must succeed at an ~attack roll~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL]
TAG_5_FOOT_STEP	TAG_COMBAT			5-foot Step	A small position adjustment that does not count as an action.  Usually, a 5-foot step is permitted at any point in the round (such as before or after a ~full-round action~[TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION], between attacks in a full attack, between a ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION] and a ~move action~[TAG_MOVEMENT_ACTION], or between two move actions).  You can't take a 5-foot step:-in the same round that you move any distance-if your movement is hampered, such as into a square of difficult terrain, in darkness, or when blindedTaking a 5-foot step does not provoke an ~attack of opportunity~[TAG_AOO].
TAG_EXOTIC_WEAPONS	TAG_WEAPONS			Exotic Weapons	Light Melee Weapons~Kama~[TAG_WEAPONS_KAMA]~Sai~[TAG_WEAPONS_SAI]~Siangham~[TAG_WEAPONS_SIANGHAM]One-Handed Melee Weapons~Bastard Sword~[TAG_WEAPONS_SWORD_BASTARD]~Dwarven Waraxe~[TAG_WEAPONS_WARAXE_DWARVEN]Ranged Weapons~Repeating Crossbow~[TAG_WEAPONS_CROSSBOW_REPEATING]~Shuriken~[TAG_WEAPONS_SHURIKEN]
TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_ABJURATION	TAG_MAGIC			Abjuration	Abjurations are protective spells.  They create physical or magical barriers, negate magical or physical abilities, harm trespassers, or even banish the subject of the spell to another plane of existence.  Representative spells include  ~Protection From Evil~[TAG_SPELLS_PROTECTION_FROM_EVIL] and ~Dispel Magic~[TAG_SPELLS_DISPEL_MAGIC].     If an abjuration creates a barrier that keeps certain types of creatures at bay, that barrier cannot be used to push away those creatures.  
TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_CONJURATION	TAG_MAGIC			Conjuration	Each conjuration spell belongs to one of five subschools.Calling: Can transport creatures from another plane of existence to your plane.  The spell grants the creature the one-time ability to return to its plane of origin.  Creatures who are called actually die when they are killed; they don't just disappear and reform.  The duration of a calling spell is instantaneous.Creation: Can create objects or effects on the spot.  If the spell's duration is not instantaneous, magic will hold the creation together, and when the spell ends, the conjured creature or object vanishes without a trace.  If the spell's duration is instantaneous, the created object or creature is merely assembled through magic, and will last indefinitely, as it does not depend on magic for its existence.Healing: Certain divine conjurations heal creatures or even bring them back to life.  These include Cure spells (for example, ~Cure Minor Wounds~[TAG_SPELLS_CURE_MINOR_WOUNDS]), which good ~clerics~[TAG_CLERICS] can cast spontaneously.Teleportation: Can transport one or more creatures or objects a great distance.  The most powerful of these spells can cross planar boundaries.  Teleportation is one-way and not dispellable.  It is instantaneous travel through the Astral Plane; therefore, anything that blocks astral travel also blocks teleportation.Summoning: Can bring manifestations of objects, creatures, or some form of energy to you.  When the spell ends or is dispelled, a summoned creature is instantly sent back, but only if the spell description indicates this.  A summoned creature also goes away if it is killed or if its hit points drop to 0 or lower, but it is not really dead.  It will reform in 24 hours and can't be summoned again during this time.  
TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_DIVINATION	TAG_MAGIC			Divination	Divination spells enable you to learn secrets long forgotten, to predict the future, to find hidden things, and to foil deceptive spells.  Representative spells include ~Identify~[TAG_SPELLS_IDENTIFY], ~Clairaudience/Clairvoyance~[TAG_SPELLS_CLAIRAUDIENCE_CLAIRVOYANCE], and ~True Seeing~[TAG_SPELLS_TRUE_SEEING].Scrying: A scrying spell creature is an invisible magical sensor that sends you information.  Unless noted otherwise, the sensor has the same powers of any sensory acuity that you possess.  This level of acuity includes any spells or effects that target you (such as ~See Invisibility~[TAG_SPELLS_SEE_INVISIBILITY]), but not spells that emanate from you (such as ~Detect Evil~[TAG_SPELLS_DETECT_EVIL]).  However, the sensor functions as an independent organ, so it will continue to work even if you are blinded, deafened, etc. 
TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_ENCHANTMENT	TAG_MAGIC			Enchantment	Enchantment spells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior.  Representative spells include ~Charm Person~[TAG_SPELLS_CHARM_PERSON].  All enchantments are mind-affecting spells.  Two types of enchantment spells grant you influence over a subject creature:Charm: A charm spell changes how the subject views you, typically in a positive manner, ensuring that they see you as a good friend.Compulsion: A compulsion spell forces the subject to act in some manner or changes the way his mind works.  Some compulsion spells determine the subject's actions or the effects on the subject, some allow you to determine the subject's actions when you cast the spell, and others give you ongoing control over the subject.
TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_EVOCATION	TAG_MAGIC			Evocation	Evocation spells manipulate energy or tap an unseen source of power to produce a desired end.  In effect, they create something out of nothing.  Many of these spells produce spectacular effects, and evocation spells can deal large amounts of damage.  Representative spells include ~Magic Missile~[TAG_SPELLS_MAGIC_MISSILE], ~Fireball~[TAG_SPELLS_FIREBALL], and ~Lightning Bolt~[TAG_SPELLS_LIGHTNING_BOLT].
TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_ILLUSION	TAG_MAGIC			Illusion	Illusion spells deceive the senses or minds of others.  They cause people to see things that are not there, not see things that are there, hear phantom noises, or remember things that never happened.  Representative illusions include ~Invisibility~[TAG_SPELLS_INVISIBILITY].  Illusions come in the following five types:Figments: These spells create a false sensation, one that is the same regardless of who experiences it.  Figments are unable to make something seem to be something else.  For example, a figment spell with audible effects cannot duplicate intelligible speech unless the spell specifically says it can.  Figments cannot produce real effects, and therefore, are useless for directly attacking foes.Glamer: A glamer spell changes a subject's sensory qualities, making it look, feel, taste, smell, or sound like something else, or even seem to disappear.Pattern: This creates an image that others can see and also affects the minds of those who see it or are caught in it.  Phantasm: Creates a mental image that usually only the caster and the subject(s) of the spell can perceive.  This image is totally within the minds of the subjects and is a personalized mental impression.  Third parties don't notice the phantasm.Shadow: Creates something that is partially real.  The caster weaves it from extradimensional energies.  Such illusions can have real effects.  If a creature takes damage from a shadow illusion, that damage is real.Saving Throws and Illusions (Disbelief): Creatures encountering an illusion effect usually do not receive ~saving throws~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] to recognize it as illusory until they study it carefully or interact with it in some fashion.  A successful saving throw against an illusion reveals it to be false, but a figment or phantasm remains as a translucent outline.  A failed saving throw indicates that a character fails to notice something is amiss.
TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_NECROMANCY	TAG_MAGIC			Necromancy	Necromancy spells manipulate the power of death, unlife, and the life force.  Spells involving undead creatures make up a large part of this school.  Representative spells include ~Cause Fear~[TAG_SPELLS_CAUSE_FEAR] and ~Animate Dead~[TAG_SPELLS_ANIMATE_DEAD].
TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_TRANSMUTATION	TAG_MAGIC			Transmutation	Transmutation spells change the properties of some creature, thing, or condition.  Representative spells include ~Reduce Person~[TAG_SPELLS_REDUCE_PERSON].
TAG_SPELLS_BEAR'S_ENDURANCE	TAG_SPELLS		TAG_CLERIC_2 TAG_DRUID_2 TAG_RANGER_2 TAG_SORCERER_2 TAG_WIZARD_2	Bear's Endurance	~Transmutation~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_TRANSMUTATION]Level: ~Clr~[TAG_CLERICS] 2, ~Drd~[TAG_DRUIDS] 2, ~Rgr~[TAG_RANGERS] 2, ~Sor~[TAG_SORCERERS]/~Wiz~[TAG_WIZARDS] 2Components: V, SCasting Time: 1 ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION]Range: TouchTarget: Creature touchedDuration: 1 min/levelSaving Throw: ~Will~[TAG_WILL] negates (harmless)Spell Resistance: YesThe affected creature gains greater vitality and stamina.  The spell grants the subject a +4 enhancement bonus to ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION], which adds the usual benefits to hit points, ~Fortitude~[TAG_FORTITUDE] saves, Constitution checks, and so forth.  Hit points gained by a temporary increase in Constitution score are not ~temporary hit points~[TAG_TEMPORARY_HIT_POINTS].  They go away when the subject's Constitution drops back to normal.  They are not lost first as temporary hit points are.
TAG_SPELLS_HIDE_FROM_ANIMALS	TAG_SPELLS		TAG_DRUID_1 TAG_RANGER_1	Hide From Animals	~Abjuration~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_ABJURATION]Level: ~Drd~[TAG_DRUIDS] 1, ~Rgr~[TAG_RANGERS] 1Components: SCasting Time: 1 ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION]Range: TouchTarget: One creature touched / levelDuration: 10 min. / levelSaving Throw: ~Will~[TAG_WILL] negates (harmless)Spell Resistance: YesAnimals cannot see, hear, or smell the warded creatures (or recipients) of this spell. Animals simply act as though the warded creatures are not there. If a warded character touches an animal or attacks any creature, even with a spell, Hide from Animals will be disrupted and the spell is over. 
TAG_SPELLS_HIDE_FROM_UNDEAD	TAG_SPELLS		TAG_CLERIC_1	Hide From Undead	~Abjuration~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_ABJURATION]Level: ~Clr~[TAG_CLERICS] 1Components: V, SCasting Time: 1 ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION]Range: TouchTargets: One creature touched / levelDuration: 10 min. / levelSaving Throw: ~Will~[TAG_WILL] negates (harmless); see textSpell Resistance: YesUndead cannot see, hear, or smell the warded creatures (or recipients) of this spell. Undead creatures simply act as though the warded creatures are not there. Nonintelligent undead creatures are automatically affected and act as though the warded creatures do not exist. An intelligent undead creature gets a single Will saving throw. If it fails, the subject can't see any of the creatures.    If a warded creature attempts to turn or command undead, touches an undead creature, or attacks any creature (even with a spell), the spell ends for all recipients.
TAG_SPELLS_REDUCE_PERSON	TAG_SPELLS		TAG_SORCERER_1 TAG_WIZARD_1	Reduce Person	~Transmutation~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_TRANSMUTATION]Level: ~Sor~[TAG_SORCERERS]/~Wiz~[TAG_WIZARDS] 1Components: V, SCasting Time: 1 roundRange: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./ 2 levels)Target: One humanoid creatureDuration: 1 min./ levelSaving Throw: ~Fortitude~[TAG_FORTITUDE] negatesSpell Resistance: YesThis spell causes instant diminution of a humanoid creature, halving its height, length, and width, and dividing its weight by 8.  This decrease changes the creature's size category to the next smaller one.  The target gains a +2 size bonus to ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY], a -2 size penalty to ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] (to a minimum of 1), and a +1 bonus on attack rolls and AC due to its reduced size.  A creature's size will be reduced to one category below the size that they were previously.  For example, a Large humanoid creature will decrease to a Medium humanoid creature and then have a space of 5 feet and a natural reach of 5 feet (previously, the Large creature would have had a 10 foot reach; now it's 5, as a Medium creature).  This spell doesn't change the target's speed.  All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly reduced by the spell.  Melee and projectile weapons deal less damage.  For example, if the victim of the spell formerly had attack damage of 4d8, it will decrease to 4d6.  Any reduced weapon that leaves the reduced creature's possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size.  But the reduced weapon will continue to deal less damage until the attack is complete.   Multiple magical effects that reduce size do not stack, which means (among other things) that you can't use a second casting of this spell to further reduce the size of a humanoid that's still under the effect of the first casting.  Reduce Person counters and dispels ~Enlarge Person~[TAG_SPELLS_ENLARGE_PERSON].
TAG_OUT_OF_COMBAT	TAG_COMBAT			Out of Combat	Out of Combat describes a casting time that is anything longer than a round during combat.
TAG_STONECUNNING	TAG_DWARVES			Stonecunning	Stonecunning grants dwarves a +2 racial bonus on checks to notice unusual stonework, such as sliding walls, stonework traps, new construction, unsafe stone surfaces, shaky stone ceilings, and the like.
TAG_LEVEL_LOSS	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Level Loss	In ToEE, Level Loss is experienced by the character as a draining of experience points, instead of simply losing a level.  For example, if a 6th-level fighter dies during combat, she will not automatically be dropped to 5th-level, but rather will lose an appropriate amount of XP.    This character condition can be countered with ~Restoration~[TAG_SPELLS_RESTORATION], which will restore the character with enough XP to put them at the minimum amount of their previous level.  
TAG_COMBAT_AND_GAME_PLAY	TAG_COMBAT			Combat and Game Play	When entering combat, a row of character and monster portraits will appear at the top of the screen, in order of initiative, which is determined by the computer.  On the left side of the screen, a bar will appear.  The combat system in the game translates the actions you have available into a numerical score and displays that score as a bar, with three colors.  The action bar, path movement, and the entries on the radial menu are all color coded as follows:  Green:  An action can be performed, and you will still be able to attackafterward (for ~move actions~[TAG_MOVEMENT_ACTION]) or move afterward (for attacks).Yellow: An action can be performed, but you will not be able to attack afterward (for move actions) or move much (for attacks).Red: An action cannot be performed.Combat options that fall into the categories of ~full~[TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION], ~standard~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION], ~movement~[TAG_MOVEMENT_ACTION], and ~free~[TAG_FREE_ACTION] actions can be selected in the radial menu, provided you are still able to perform these actions (otherwise, they will be "greyed out" and you cannot select them).   If you choose not to select anything from the radial menu, the only remaining option is simply to move the distance that the characters are allowed (for example, humans can move a maximum of 30 feet in a single move).    
TAG_SPELLS_CATS_GRACE	TAG_SPELLS		TAG_BARD_2 TAG_DRUID_2 TAG_RANGER_2 TAG_SORCERER_2 TAG_WIZARD_2	Cat's Grace	~Transmutation~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_TRANSMUTATION] Level: ~Brd~[TAG_BARDS] 2, ~Drd~[TAG_DRUIDS] 2, ~Rgr~[TAG_RANGERS] 2, ~Sor~[TAG_SORCERERS],/~Wiz~[TAG_WIZARDS] 2Components: V, SCasting Time: 1 ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION]Range: TouchTarget: Creature touchedDuration: 1 min./ levelSaving Throw: ~Will~[TAG_WILL] negates (harmless)Spell Resistance: YesThe transmuted creature becomes more graceful, agile, and coordinated.  The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY], adding the usual benefits to AC, ~Reflex~[TAG_REFLEX] saves, and other uses of the Dexterity modifier.  
TAG_NO_GOD	TAG_RELIGION			None	Your character has no patron deity and has no particular religion or religious beliefs. Note that this option is NOT available for clerics, and a character with no deity will never be able to select a level of cleric as a multi-class.
TAG_RADIAL_MENU_NONLETHAL_DAMAGE	TAG_INGAME			Nonlethal Damage	Sometimes you get roughened up or weakened, such as by getting clocked in a fistfight or tired out by a forced march.  This sort of trauma won't kill you, but it can knock you out or make you fatigued.  If you take sufficient nonlethal damage, you fall unconscious but you don't die.  Nonlethal damage goes away much faster than lethal damage does.Dealing Nonlethal Damage:    Certain attacks deal nonlethal damage, such as a human's ~unarmed strike~[TAG_WEAPONS_STRIKE_UNARMED].  Other effects, such as heat or being exhausted, also deal nonlethal damage.  Technically, nonlethal damage is not "real" damage (meaning it's not deducted from your current hit points).  Instead, when your nonlethal damage equals your current hit points, you're ~staggered~[TAG_STAGGERED], and when it exceeds your current hit points, you fall ~unconscious~[TAG_UNCONSCIOUS].  Nonlethal Damage with a Weapon that Deal Lethal Damage:   You can use a melee weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage instead, but you take a -4 penalty on your attack roll because you have to use the flat of the blade, strike at nonvital areas, or check your swing.Lethal Damage with a Weapon that Deals Nonlethal Damage:  You can use a weapon that deals nonlethal damage, including an unarmed strike, to deal lethal damage instead, but you take a -4 penalty on your attack roll because you have to strike only in the most vulnerable areas to inflict lethal damage.
TAG_RADIAL_MENU_AUTOEND_TURN	TAG_INGAME			AutoEnd Turn	AutoEnd Turn will conclude your turn if a ~5-foot step~[TAG_5_FOOT_STEP] is your only remaining option.  If you would like to take a 5-foot step as your last action in combat, be sure not to enable this option.
TAG_RADIAL_MENU_CAST_DEFENSIVELY	TAG_INGAME			Cast Defensively	You may attempt to cast a spell while paying attention to threats and avoiding blows.  In this case, you are no more vulnerable to attack than you would be if you were just standing there, so casting a spell while on the defensive does not provoke an ~attack of opportunity~[TAG_AOO].  It does, however, require a ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION] check to pull off.  Failure means that you lose the spell.
TAG_RADIAL_MENU_READY	TAG_INGAME			Ready	You may also choose to Ready an action, dependent on something that the enemy does, such as prepare to cast a spell or shoot a bow. In this case, as soon as the condition is achieved, the character will immediately enact his readied action. If the condition is not achieved, then that character fails to act in that round.
TAG_RADIAL_MENU_COUP_DE_GRACE	TAG_INGAME			Coup de Grace	As a full-round action, you can use a melee weapon to deliver a coup de grace to a helpless opponent.  You automatically hit and score a ~critical hit~[TAG_CRITICAL_HIT].  If the defender survives the damage, he must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + the damage delt) or die.Asleep, paralyzed or unconscious opponents are all considered helpless.Delivering a coup de gras provokes ~attacks of opportunity~[TAG_AOO] from threatening opponents.A coup de gras is the best way to kill ~regenerating~[TAG_REGENERATION] monsters once they have become unconscious.
TAG_RADIAL_MENU_TOTAL_DEFENSE	TAG_INGAME			Total Defense	You can defend yourself as a ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION].  You get a +4 dodge bonus to your AC for 1 round.  Your AC improves at the start of this action, so it helps you against any ~attacks of opportunity~[TAG_AOO] you incur during the round.  You can't combine total defense with ~fighting defensively~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_FIGHT_DEFENSIVELY] or with the benefit of the ~Combat Expertise~[TAG_COMBAT_EXPERTISE] feat (since both of those require you to declare an attack or ~full attack~[TAG_FULL_ATTACK]).  You can't make attacks of opportunity while using total defense.  
TAG_RADIAL_MENU_FIGHT_DEFENSIVELY	TAG_INGAME			Fight Defensively	As a ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION]:     You can choose to fight defensively when attacking.  If you do so, you take a -4 penalty on all attacks in a round to gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC for the same round.  This bonus stacks with the AC bonus granted by the ~Combat Expertise~[TAG_COMBAT_EXPERTISE] feat.As a ~full round action~[TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION]:     You can choose to fight defensively when taking a full attack action.  If you do so, you take a -4 penalty on all attacks in a round to gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC for the same round.
TAG_RADIAL_MENU_SNEAK	TAG_INGAME			Sneak	Sneak is an action that allows you to actively ~Move Silently~[TAG_MOVE_SILENTLY] and ~Hide~[TAG_HIDE] at the same time.  In order for someone to see you while you are sneaking, a ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT] check is needed.  The higher that your Hide skill is, the less likely they will be able to spot you.  Likewise, the lower your Hide skill, the more likely they will be able to spot you.  The same is true of moving silently while you're sneaking; a Listen check is needed to hear any of your movement and the skill level is measured accordingly.  While in Sneak mode in the game, you visually appear to move slower, as if you are prowling.
TAG_SPELLS_ACID_SPLASH	TAG_SPELLS		TAG_SORCERER_0 TAG_WIZARD_0	Acid Splash	~Conjuration~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_CONJURATION] (Creation) AcidLevel: ~Sor~[TAG_SORCERERS]/~Wiz~[TAG_WIZARDS] 0Components: V, SCasting Time: 1 ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION]Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./ 2 levels)Effect: One missile of acidDuration: Instantaneous~Saving Throw~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC]: NoneSpell Resistance: NoYou fire a small orb of acid at the target. You must succeed on a ranged touched attack to hit your target. The orb deals 1d3 points of acid damage.

TAG_SPELLS_DAZE_MONSTER	TAG_SPELLS		TAG_BARD_2 TAG_SORCERER_2 TAG_WIZARD_2	Daze Monster	~Enchantment~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_ENCHANTMENT] (Compulsion) Mind-AffectingLevel: ~Brd~[TAG_BARDS] 2, ~Sor~[TAG_SORCERERS]/~Wiz~[TAG_WIZARDS] 2Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./ level)Target: One living creature of 6 HD or lessThis spell functions like ~Daze~[TAG_SPELLS_DAZE], but Daze Monster can affect any one living creature of any type. Creatures of 7 or more Hit Dice are not affected. 
TAG_SPELLS_DEEP_SLUMBER	TAG_SPELLS		TAG_BARD_3 TAG_SORCERER_3 TAG_WIZARD_3	Deep Slumber	~Enchantment~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_ENCHANTMENT] (Compulsion) Mind-AffectingLevel: ~Brd~[TAG_BARDS] 3, ~Sor~[TAG_SORCERERS]/~Wiz~[TAG_WIZARDS] 3Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./ 2 levels)This spell functions like ~Sleep~[TAG_SPELLS_SLEEP], except that it affects 10 HD of creatures.  
TAG_SPELLS_EAGLE'S_SPLENDOR	TAG_SPELLS		TAG_BARD_2 TAG_CLERIC_2 TAG_PALADIN_2 TAG_SORCERER_2 TAG_WIZARD_2	Eagle's Splendor	~Transmutation~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_TRANSMUTATION]Level: ~Brd~[TAG_BARDS] 2, ~Clr~[TAG_CLERICS] 2, ~Pal~[TAG_PALADINS] 2, ~Sor~[TAG_SORCERERS]/~Wiz~[TAG_WIZARDS] 2Components: V, SCasting Time: 1 ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION]Range: TouchTarget: Creature touchedDuration: 1 min./ levelSaving Throw: ~Will~[TAG_WILL] negates (harmless)Spell Resistance: YesThe transmuted creature becomes more poised, articulate, and personally forceful. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA], adding the usual benefits to Charisma-based skill checks and other uses of the Charisma modifier. Sorcerers and bards (and other spellcasters who rely on Charisma) affected by this spell do not gain any additional bonus spells for the increased Charisma, but the save DCs for spells they cast while under this spell's effect do increase. 
TAG_SPELLS_FALSE_LIFE	TAG_SPELLS		TAG_SORCERER_2 TAG_WIZARD_2	False Life	~Necromancy~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_NECROMANCY]Level: ~Sor~[TAG_SORCERERS]/~Wiz~[TAG_WIZARDS] 2Components: V, SCasting Time: 1 ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION]Range: PersonalTarget: YouDuration: 1 hour/level or until discharged; see textYou harness the power of unlife to grant yourself a limited ability to avoid death. While this spell is in effect, you gain ~temporary hit points~[TAG_TEMPORARY_HIT_POINTS] equal to 1d10 + 1 per caster level (maximum +10).  
TAG_SPELLS_FOX'S_CUNNING	TAG_SPELLS		TAG_BARD_2 TAG_SORCERER_2 TAG_WIZARD_2	Fox's Cunning	~Transmutation~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_TRANSMUTATION]Level: ~Brd~[TAG_BARDS] 2, ~Sor~[TAG_SORCERERS]/~Wiz~[TAG_WIZARDS] 2Components: V, SCasting Time: 1 ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION]Range: TouchTarget: Creature touchedDuration: 1 min./ levelSaving Throw: ~Will~[TAG_WILL] negates (harmless)Spell Resistance: YesThe transmuted creature becomes smarter. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to ~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE], adding the usual benefits to Intelligence-based skill checks and other uses of the Intelligence modifier. Wizards (and other spellcasters who rely on Intelligence) affected by this spell do not gain any additional bonus spells for the increased Intelligence, but the save DCs for spells they cast while under this spell's effect do increase. This spell doesn't grant extra skill points.
TAG_SPELLS_GLIBNESS	TAG_SPELLS		TAG_BARD_3	Glibness	~Transmutation~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_TRANSMUTATION]Level: ~Brd~[TAG_BARDS] 3Components: V, SCasting Time: 1 ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION]Range: PersonalTarget: YouDuration: 10 min. / levelYour speech becomes fluent and more believable.

If you do not choose to act as if you were disabled, you immediately fall unconscious.       When using this feat, you can take either a single move or ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION] each turn, but not both, and you cannot take a ~full-round action~[TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION]. You can take a ~move action~[TAG_MOVEMENT_ACTION] without further injuring yourself, but if you perform any standard action, you take 1 point of damage after completing the act.  If you reach -10 hit points, you immediately die.     Normal: A character without this feat who is reduced to between -1 and -9 hit points is unconscious and dying.

For example, while in the form of a hawk, you could substitute screeches and gestures with your talons for the normal verbal and somatic components of a spell. You can also use any material components or focuses you possess, even if such items are melded within your current form. This feat does not permit the use of magic items while you are in a form that could not ordinarily use them, and you do not gain the ability to speak while in a wild shape.     
TAG_NEGOTIATOR	TAG_FEATS_DES			Negotiator	You are good at gauging and swaying attitudes.     Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on all ~Diplomacy~[TAG_DIPLOMACY] checks and ~Sense Motive~[TAG_SENSE_MOTIVE] checks.

Both arrows use the same attack roll (with a -4 penalty) to determine success and deal damage normally.    Precision-based damage (such as ~sneak attack~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_SNEAK_ATTACK] damage) is applied only once. If you score a critical hit, only the first arrow fired deals critical damage; all others deal regular damage.     Damage reduction and other resistances apply separately against each arrow fired.      
TAG_RAPID_RELOAD	TAG_FEATS_DES			Rapid Reload	     You can reload a crossbow of type ~heavy~[TAG_WEAPONS_CROSSBOW_HEAVY] or ~light~[TAG_WEAPONS_CROSSBOW_LIGHT] more quickly than normal.       Prerequisite: Weapon Proficiency (heavy or light).     Benefit: The time required for you to reload your chosen type of crossbow is reduced to a ~free action~[TAG_FREE_ACTION] (for a light crossbow) or a ~move action~[TAG_MOVEMENT_ACTION] (for a heavy crossbow). Reloading a crossbow still provokes an ~attack of opportunity~[TAG_AOO].     If you have selected this feat for light or hand crossbow, you may fire that weapon as many times in a ~full attack~[TAG_FULL_ATTACK] action as if you could attack if you were using a bow.     Normal: A character without this feat needs a move action to reload a light crossbow, or a full-round action to reload a heavy crossbow.     A ~fighter~[TAG_FIGHTERS] may select Rapid Reload as one of her fighter bonus feats.
TAG_SELF_SUFFICIENT	TAG_FEATS_DES			Self-Sufficient	You can take care of yourself in harsh environments and situations.     Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on all ~Heal~[TAG_HEAL] checks and ~Survival~[TAG_SURVIVAL] checks.

Your spells of that schools are now even more potent than before.     Benefit: Add +1 to the Difficulty Class for all ~saving throws~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] against spells from the school of magic you select. This bonus stacks with the bonus from Spell Focus.     Special: You can gain this feat multiple times.  Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new school of magic to which you already have applied the Spell Focus feat.
TAG_GREATER_SPELL_PENETRATION	TAG_FEATS_DES			Greater Spell Penetration	Your spells are remarkably potent, breaking through ~spell resistance~[TAG_SPELLS_SPELL_RESISTANCE] more readily than normal.     Prerequisite: ~Spell Penetration~[TAG_SPELL_PENETRATION].     Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on caster level checks made to overcome a creature's spell resistance.

TAG_GREATER_WEAPON_FOCUS	TAG_FEATS_DES			Greater Weapon Focus	Choose one type of weapon, such as ~greataxe~[TAG_WEAPONS_GREATAXE], for which you have already selected ~Weapon Focus~[TAG_WEAPON_FOCUS]. You can also choose ~unarmed strike~[TAG_WEAPONS_STRIKE_UNARMED] or ~grapple~[TAG_GRAPPLE] as your weapon for the purpose of this feat. You are especially good at using this weapon.     Prerequisites: Proficiency with selected weapon, Weapon Focus with selected weapon, ~fighter~[TAG_FIGHTERS] level 8th.     Benefit: You gain a +1 bonus on all attack rolls you make using the selected weapon. This bonus stacks with other bonuses on attack rolls, including the one from Weapon Focus.     Special: You can gain Greater Weapon Focus multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of weapon.     A fighter may select Greater Weapon Focus as one of his fighter bonus feats.
TAG_EXTEND_SPELL	TAG_FEATS_DES			Extend Spell	You can cast spells that last longer than normal.     Benefit: An extended spell lasts twice as long as normal. A spell with a duration of concentration, an instantaneous spell, or a permanent spell is not affected by this feat. An extended spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.
TAG_DISEASED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Diseased	When a character is injured by a contaminated attack, touches an item smeared with disease matter, or consumes disease-tainted food or drink, he or she must make an immediate ~Fortitude~[TAG_FORTITUDE] saving throw.  If the person succeeds, the disease has no effect--their immune system fought off the infection. If the saving throw is failed, they take damage after an incubation period. Once per day afterward, the character must make a successful Fortitude saving throw to avoid repeated damage.  Two successful saving throws in a row indicate that he has fought off the disease and recovers, taking no more damage.Typical diseases include the following:Blinding Sickness: Spread in tainted water.Cackle Fever: Symptoms include high fever, disorientation, and frequent bouts of hideous laughter. Also known as "the shrieks".Demon Fever: Night hags spread it. Can cause permanent ability drain.Devil Chills: Barbazu and pit fiends spread it. It takes three, not two, successful saves in a row to recover from devil chills.Filth Fever: Dire rats and otyughs spread it. Those injured while in filthy surroundings might also catch it.Mindfire: Feels like your brain is burning. Causes stupor.Mummy Rot: Spread by mummies. Successful saving throws do not allow the character to recover (though they do prevent damage normally).Red Ache: Skin turns red, bloated, and warm to the touch.The Shakes: Causes involuntary twitches, tremors, and fits.Slimy Doom: Victim turns into infectious goo from the inside out. Can cause permanent ability drain.Disease                              DC          DamageBlinding Sickness             @t16       @t1d4 ~Str~[TAG_STRENGTH]Cackle fever                    @t16           @t1d6 ~Wis~[TAG_WISDOM]Filth fever                            @t12           @t1d3 ~Dex~[TAG_DEXTERITY]                                                           @tand 1d3 ~Con~[TAG_CONSTITUTION]Mindfire                               @t12           @t1d4 ~Int~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE]Red ache                            @t15           @t1d6 StrShakes                               @t13           @t1d8 DexSlimy doom                        @t14           @t1d4 Con 
TAG_SLEEPING	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Sleeping	If you are the recipient of a Sleep spell, you fall into a magical slumber. As a sleeping creature, you are helpless and normal noise cannot be used to wake you.
TAG_TEMPORARY_HIT_POINTS	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Temporary Hit Points	Certain effects, such as the ~Aid~[TAG_SPELLS_AID] spell, give a character temporary hit points. When a character gains temporary hit points, he should take note of his current hit point total. When the temporary hit points go away, such as at the end of the Aid spell's duration, the character's hit points drop to his current hit point total. If the character's hit points are below his current hit point total at that time, all the temporary hit points have already been lost and the character's hit point total does not drop further.  When temporary hit points are lost, they cannot be restored as real hit points can be, even by magic.
TAG_CHARMED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Charmed	As the subject of a Charm spell (either ~Charm Animal~[TAG_SPELLS_CHARM_ANIMAL] or ~Charm Person~[TAG_SPELLS_CHARM_PERSON]), you essentially retain some form of free will, but make choices according to the suggestive powers of the spell. Your mind may be clouded and you may suddenly be unable to tell friend from foe. However, the spells do not render you helpless and there are restrictions to what can be done, including the following.     -A charmed character retains his original alignment and allegiances, generally with the exception that he now regards the creature who charmed him as a dear friend.     -A charmed character fights his former allies only if they threaten his new friend, and even then he uses the least lethal means at his disposal.     -A charmed character is entitled to an opposing ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA] check against his master in order to resist instructions or commands that would make him do something he wouldn't do even for a close friend. If he succeeds, he decides not to follow that order but remains charmed.     -A charmed character never obeys a command that is obviously suicidal or grievously harmful to him.     -A charmed character who is openly attacked by the creature who charmed him or by that creature's apparent allies is automatically freed of the spell or effect.
TAG_HOLDING_A_CHARGE	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Holding a Charge	As a spellcaster, if you don't discharge a touch spell on the round that you cast it, you can hold the charge (postpone the discharge of the spell) indefinitely. You can make touch attacks round after round. You can touch one friend (or yourself) as a ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION] or as many as six friends as a ~full-round action~[TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION]. If you touch anything with your hand while holding a charge, the spell discharges. If you cast another spell, the touch spell dissipates.
TAG_SILENT_SPELL	TAG_FEATS_DES			Silent Spell	You can cast spells silently.     Benefit: A silent spell can be cast with no verbal components. Spells without verbal components are not affected. A silent spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.     Special: ~Bard~[TAG_BARDS] spells cannot be enhanced by this metamagic feat.
TAG_STILL_SPELL	TAG_FEATS_DES			Still Spell	You can cast spells without gestures.     Benefit: A stilled spell can be cast with no somatic components. Spells without somatic components are not affected. A stilled spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level. 
TAG_WIDEN_SPELL	TAG_FEATS_DES			Widen Spell	You can increase the area of your spells.     Benefit: You can alter a burst, emanation, line, or spread-shaped spell to increase its area. Any numeric measurements of the spell's area increase by 100%. For example, a ~Fireball~[TAG_SPELLS_FIREBALL] spell (which normally produces a 20-ft.-radius spread) that is widened now fills a 40-ft.-radius spread. A widened spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell's actual level.     Spells that do not have an area of one of these four sorts are not affected by this feat.
TAG_SNATCH_ARROWS	TAG_FEATS_DES			Snatch Arrows	You are adept at grabbing incoming arrows, as well as crossbow bolts, spears, and other projectile or thrown weapons.     Prerequisites: ~Dex~[TAG_DEXTERITY] 15, ~Deflect Arrows~[TAG_DEFLECT_ARROWS], ~Improved Unarmed Strike~[TAG_IMPROVED_UNARMED].     Benefit: When using the Snatch Arrows feat, you catch the weapon instead of just deflecting it. Thrown weapons, such as spears or axes, are immediately thrown back at the original attacker (even though it isn't your turn).     You must have at least one hand free (holding nothing) to use this feat.     Special: A ~fighter~[TAG_FIGHTERS] may select Snatch Arrows as one of his fighter bonus feats.
TAG_CHARGEN_PARTY_POOL	TAG_CHARGEN			Party Pool	The character pool interface is used for the creation and organization of your party. Once you create a character, the character may be added and listed on screen, with their portrait, name, and main information. There are four buttons lining the top portion of the interface--create, view, modify, and delete. Create will bring you to the character creation interface, where you will roll stats and choose your character's class, race, and other attributes. Clicking on View will bring up a small window that holds information about a particular character in your party (the basic defining traits like class and race, as well as their character stats, etc.) Choosing the button Modify will allow you to change certain aspects of a character. Delete permanently erases the selected character from the party. Toward the bottom of the interface is a button that will either read as Add or Remove, depending on the appropriate action needed. Once a new character is created and listed in the interface, you will need to select Add in order for the character to actually be included in the party. First, click on the desired character's portrait located in the row directly underneath the Add button (the character will be highlighted in blue to indicate the selection), then click Add.If the character's alignment or class does not conflict with the party alignment that was chosen, he or she will be added to the party and highlighted in green to indicate the successful addition. If the character's alignment does conflict, then the character will be highlighted in red, indicating that it is not possible to add that character to the party. Likewise, if there is a conflict regarding class and the alignment of the party (specifically, with ~Paladins~[TAG_PALADINS], as they cannot be added to any parties with evil characters) then that character will not be added.If you would like to exclude a character from your party but not permanently delete them, click on their picture in the portrait row and select Remove. The character will no longer be highlighted in green and is removed from the party, but it will still be listed among the other party members, if you wish to add them again at a later time.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARBARIAN_TRAP_SENSE	TAG_BARBARIANS			Trap Sense	Starting at 3rd level, a ~barbarian~[TAG_BARBARIANS] has an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, giving him a +1 bonus on ~Reflex~[TAG_REFLEX] saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses rise by +1 every three barbarian levels thereafter (at 6th and 9th level). Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack. 
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARBARIAN_IMPROVED_UNCANNY_DODGE	TAG_BARBARIANS			Improved Uncanny Dodge	At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be ~flanked~[TAG_FLANKING]; he can react to opponents on opposite sides of him as easily as he can react to a single attacker. This defense denies a ~rogue~[TAG_ROGUES] the ability to ~sneak attack~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_SNEAK_ATTACK] the barbarian by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels.  If a character already has ~uncanny dodge~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARBARIAN_UNCANNY_DODGE] from a second class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead, and the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character. 
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARBARIAN_DAMAGE_REDUCTION	TAG_BARBARIANS			Damage Reduction	At 7th level, a barbarian gains the ability to shrug off some amount of injury from each blow or attack. 1 point of damage is subtracted each time a barbarian is dealt damage from a weapon or natural attack. At 10th level, the damage reduction rises by 1 point, so 2 points of damage total is subtracted at that level. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0. 
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_SPELLS	TAG_BARDS			Spells	A bard casts ~arcane spells~[TAG_ARCANE_SPELLS] (the same type of spells available to sorcerers and wizards) which are drawn from the bard spell list. A bard can cast any spell he or she knows without preparing for it ahead of time. Every bard spell has a verbal component. To learn or cast a spell, a bard must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Cha 10 for 0-Level spells, Cha 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth). 
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_CLERIC_SPELLS	TAG_CLERICS			Spells	A cleric casts ~divine~[TAG_DIVINE_SPELLS] spells (the same type of spells available to the ~druid~[TAG_DRUIDS], ~paladin~[TAG_PALADINS], and ~ranger~[TAG_RANGERS]) which are drawn from the cleric spell list. However, a cleric's alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs.To prepare or cast a spell, a cleric must have a ~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM] score equal to 10 + the spell level (Wis 10 for 0-level spells, Wis 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth). 
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_FIGHTER_BONUS_FEATS	TAG_FIGHTERS			Bonus Feats	At 1st level, a fighter gets a bonus combat-oriented feat in addition to the feat that any 1st-level character gets and the bonus feat granted to a human character. The fighter gains an additional bonus feat at 2nd level and every two fighter levels thereafter (4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th). A fighter must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including ability score and base attack bonus minimums. These bonus feats are in addition to the feat that a character of any class gets every three levels. 
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_BONUS_FEAT	TAG_MONKS			Monk: Bonus Feat	1st level: may select ~Stunning Fist~[TAG_STUNNING_FIST]2nd level: may select either ~Combat Reflexes~[TAG_COMBAT_REFLEXES] or ~Deflect Arrows~[TAG_DEFLECT_ARROWS]6th level: may select ~Improved Trip~[TAG_IMPROVED_TRIP]A monk need not have any of the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_PALADIN_AURA_OF_GOOD	TAG_PALADINS			Aura of Good	The power of a paladin's aura of good (see the ~Detect Good~[TAG_SPELLS_DETECT_GOOD] spell) is equal to her paladin level, just like the aura of a cleric of a good deity. 
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_RANGER_COMBAT_STYLE	TAG_RANGERS			Combat Style	At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. If the ranger selects archery, he is treated as having the ~Rapid Shot~[TAG_RAPID_SHOT] feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. If the ranger selects two-weapon combat, he is treated as having the ~Two-Weapon Fighting~[TAG_TWO_FIGHTING] feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. The benefits of the ranger's chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_RANGER_ANIMAL_COMPANION	TAG_RANGERS			Animal Companion	At 4th level, a ranger gains an animal companion selected from the following list: dire rat, dog, chicken, lizard, jackal, brown bear, polar bear, panda bear, or wolf.  This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its species.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_RANGER_SWIFT_TRACKER	TAG_RANGERS			Swift Tracker	Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while following tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_RANGER_EVASION	TAG_RANGERS			Evasion 	At 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility.  If he makes a successful ~Reflex~[TAG_REFLEX] saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save (such as a Fireball), he instead takes no damage.  Evasion can be used only if a ranger is wearing light armor or no armor.  A ~helpless~[TAG_HELPLESS] ranger (such as one who is unconscious or paralyzed) does not gain the benefit of evasion.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_EVASION	TAG_ROGUES			Evasion	A rogue of 2nd level and higher can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility.  If she makes a successful ~Reflex~[TAG_REFLEX] saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save (such as a Fireball), she instead takes no damage.  Evasion can be used only if a rogue is wearing light armor or no armor.  A ~helpless~[TAG_HELPLESS] rogue (such as one who is unconscious or paralyzed) does not gain the benefit of evasion.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_IMPROVED_UNCANNY_DODGE	TAG_ROGUES			Improved Uncanny Dodge	A rogue of 8th level or higher can no longer be ~flanked~[TAG_FLANKING]; she can react to opponents on opposite sides of her as easily as she can react to a single attacker. This defense denies another rogue the ability to ~sneak attack~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_SNEAK_ATTACK] the rogue by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.  If a character already has ~uncanny dodge~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_UNCANNY_DODGE] from a second class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead, and the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character. 
TAG_CHARGEN_CLERIC_DOMAIN_SELECTION	TAG_CHARGEN			Cleric Domain Selection	In the process of creating a character who is a cleric, you will be asked to select cleric domains suitable for this character's alignment and chosen deity. The domains selected will provide your cleric with domain powers and spells. In the cleric domain selection interface, the available domains will be listed on the left, with a space for multiple selections on the right. You will need to select and drag two domains into the space shown, which is a small box with the heading "Domains:".      If the character is a neutral cleric who worships a neutral deity, additional information is needed, and a question will appear asking if your cleric character will be more proficient in wielding positive or negative energy. Only a neutral cleric of a neutral deity will be asked to provide this information. Click on the button that reads either "positive" or "negative" to make your decision.      Once the player makes this choice, it cannot be reversed. This decision will determine whether the cleric will spontaneously cast Cure or Inflict spells and will also dictate whether the cleric turns or commands undead. In other words, a cleric who chooses to wield positive energy will spontaneously cast Cure spells and turn undead, while a cleric who decides to wield negative energy will spontaneously cast Inflict spells and command undead.
TAG_CHARGEN_WIZARD_SPECIALIZATION	TAG_CHARGEN			Wizard Specialization	A school is one of eight groupings of spells, each defined by a common theme, such as ~Illusion~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_ILLUSION] or ~Necromancy~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_NECROMANCY]. If desired, a wizard may specialize in one school of magic. Specialization allows a wizard to cast extra spells from her chosen school, but then she never learns to cast spells from some other schools. Essentially, the wizard gains exceptional mastery over a single school by neglecting the study of other schools.  A specialist wizard can prepare one additional spell of her specialty per school per spell level each day. She also gains a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks to learn the spells of her chosen school.  The wizard must choose whether to specialize and, if she does so, choose her specialty. At this time, she must also give up two other schools of magic which become her prohibited schools. In the character creation interface, under features, a wizard has the option of choosing such a school by selecting from the list entitled Available Schools. You will drag this school into the box with the heading "Specialized School" and then choose two other schools to be dragged into the Prohibited Schools box that is outlined in red.   An exception to the rules noted above is the school of divination. If divination is chosen as the school that the wizard character will specialize in, then only one school must be selected for the Prohibited Schools box. 
TAG_SIZE_MODIFIER	TAG_COMBAT			Size Modifiers	The smaller you are, the bigger other creatures are relative to you. A human is a big target to a halfling, just as an ogre is a big target to a human. Since this same size modifer applies to Armor Class, two creatures of the same size strike each other normally, regardless of what size they actually are.Size /Size Modifier:Fine  (+8)Diminutive (+4)Tiny  (+2)Small  (+1)Medium (+0)Large  (-1)Huge (-2)Gargantuan (-4)Colossal (-8)
TAG_RANGE_PENALTY	TAG_COMBAT			Range Penalty	The range penalty for a ranged weapon depends on the weapon and the distance to the target. All ranged weapons have a range increment, such as 10 feet for a thrown dagger or 120 feet for a heavy crossbow. Any attack from a distance of less than one range increment is not penalized for range, so an arrow from a shortbow (range increment 60 feet) can strike at enemies up to 59 feet away with no penalty. However, each full range increment cases a cumulative -2 penalty on the attack roll. A shortbow archer firing at a target 200 feet away takes a -6 penalty on his attack roll (because 200 feet is at least three range increments, but not four increments).
TAG_MELEE_SHOOTING	TAG_COMBAT			Shooting Into a Melee	If you shoot or throw a ranged weapon at a target that is engaged in melee with a friendly character, you take a -4 penalty on your attack roll because you have to aim carefully to avoid hitting your friend. Two characters are engaged in melee if they are enemies of each other and either threatens the other. (An unconscious or otherwise immobilized character is not considered engaged unless he is actually being attacked.)If your target (or the part of your target you're aiming at, if it's a big target) is at least 10 feet away from the nearest friendly character, you can avoid the -4 penalty, even if the creature you're aiming at is engaged in melee with a friendly character.If you have the ~Precise Shot~[TAG_PRECISE_SHOT] feat, you don't take this penalty.
TAG_MULTIPLE_ATTACKS	TAG_COMBAT			Multiple Attacks	If you get more than one attack per round because your base attack bonus is high enough, because you fight with ~two weapons~[TAG_TWO_WEAPONS] or a double weapon, or for some special reason (such as a feat or a magic item), you must use a ~full-round action~[TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION] to get your additional attacks. You do not need to specify the targets of your attacks ahead of time. You can see how the earlier attacks turn out before assigning the later ones.Each attack gets it's own ~attack roll~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL].
TAG_FLANKING	TAG_COMBAT			Flanking	When making a melee attack, you get a +2 flanking bonus if your opponent is threatened by a character or creature friendly to you on the opponent's opposite side or opposite corner.When in doubt about whether two friendly characters flank an opponent in the middle, trace an imaginary line between the two friendly characters' centers. If the line passes through opposite sides of the opponent's space (including corners of those sides), then the opponent is flanked.Exception: If a flanker takes up more than 1 square, it gets the flanking bonus if any square it occupies counts for flanking.Only a creature or character that threatens the defender can help an attacker get a flanking bonus.Creatures with a reach of 0 feet can't flank an opponent.
TAG_HELPLESS	TAG_COMBAT			Helpless	An opponent who is bound, sleeping, paralyzed, unconscious, or otherwise at your mercy is considered helpless. A helpless character takes a -4 penalty to AC against melee attacks, but no penalty to AC against ranged attacks. A helpless defender can't use any Dexterity bonus to AC. In fact, his Dexterity score is treated as if it were 0 and his Dexterity modifier to AC as if it were -5 (and a rogue can sneak attack him).As a ~full-round action~[TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION], you can use a melee weapon to deliver a ~coup de grace~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_COUP_DE_GRACE] to a helpless opponent.
TAG_COVER	TAG_COMBAT			Cover	Targets which take cover behind a low obstacle or another creature get a +4 bonus to their AC.You can view which creatures or objects are providing cover by holding down the left mouse button when attacking.  Cover is indicated by a red circle.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_AC_BONUS	TAG_MONKS			Monk AC Bonus	A monk is highly trained at dodging blows, and she has a sixth sense that lets her avoid even unanticipated attacks.  When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds her ~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM] bonus (if any) to her AC.  In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC at 5th level.  This bonus increases by 1 for every 5 levels thereafter.  These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is ~flat-footed~[TAG_FLAT_FOOTED].  She loses these bonuses when she is immobilized or ~helpless~[TAG_HELPLESS], when she wears any armor, when she carries a shield, or when she carries a medium or heavy load.
TAG_THIEVES_TOOLS	TAG_TOOLS			Thieves' Tools	This kit contains the tools you need to use the ~Disable Device~[TAG_DISABLE_DEVICE] and ~Open Lock~[TAG_OPEN_LOCK] skills.  The kit includes one or more skeleton keys, long metal picks and pries, a long-nosed clamp, a small hand saw and a small wedge and hammer.  Without these tools, you must improvise tools, and you take a -2 circumstance penalty on Disable Device and Open Lock checks.
TAG_THIEVES_TOOLS_MASTERWORK	TAG_TOOLS			Thieves' Tools, Masterwork	This kit contains extra tools and tools of better make, which grant a +2 circumstance bonus on ~Disable Device~[TAG_DISABLE_DEVICE] and ~Open Lock~[TAG_OPEN_LOCK] checks.
TAG_ITEM_COMPOSITE_BOW	TAG_WEAPONS			Composite Bows	All composite bows are made with a particular strength rating (that is, each requires a minimum Strength modifier to wuse with proficiency).  If your Strength bonus is lower than the strength rating of the composite bow, you take a -2 penalty on attacks with it.Composite bows allow you to add your Strength bonus to damage, up to the bow's strength rating.For example, Tordek has a 15 strength, which gives him a +2 strength modifier.  With a regular shortbow, he gets no damage modifier.  With a composite shortbow (+1 strength bonus) he gets a +1 on his damage rolls.  With a composite shortbow (+2 strength bonus) he gets to use his full +2 bonus on damage rolls.  If he were to use a composite shortbow (+3 strength bonus) he would still only get a +2 on damage rolls and would take a -2 penalty on his to hit rolls because his Strength is insufficient to use the weapon to it's best advantage.
TAG_SPELLS_HEAL	TAG_SPELLS			Heal	~Conjuration~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_CONJURATION] (Healing)Level: ~Clr~[TAG_CLERICS] 6, ~Drd~[TAG_DRUIDS] 7, ~Healing~[TAG_HEALING_D] 6Components: V, SCasting time: 1 ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION] Range: TouchTarget: Creature touchedDuration: InstantaneousSaving Throw: ~Will~[TAG_WILL] negates (harmless)Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)Heal enables you to channel positive energy into a creature to wipe away injury and afflictions. It immediately ends any and all of the following adverse conditions affecting the target: ability damage, blinded, confused, dazed, dazzled, deafened, exhausted, fatigued, ~feeble-minded~[TAG_SPELLS_FEEBLEMIND], nauseated, sickened, stunned, and poisoned. It also cure 10 hit points of damage per level of the caster, to a maximum of 100 points at 10th level.  Heal does not remove negative levels, restore permanently drained levels, or restore permanently drained ability score points.  [CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_SPELLS_HARM	TAG_SPELLS			Harm	~Necromancy~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_NECROMANCY]Level: ~Clr~[TAG_CLERICS] 6, ~Destruction~[TAG_DESTRUCTION_D] 6Components: V, SCasting Time: 1 ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION]Range: TouchTarget: Creature touchedDuration: InstantaneousSaving Throw: ~Will~[TAG_WILL] half; see textSpell Resistance: YesHarm charges a subject with negative energy that deals 10 points of damage per caster level (to a maximum of 100 points at 10th level). If the creature successfully saves, Harm deals half this amount, but it cannot reduce the target's hit points to less than 1.  If used on an undead creature, Harm acts like ~Heal~[TAG_SPELLS_HEAL].
TAG_ENLARGE_SPELL	TAG_FEATS_DES			Enlarge Spell	You can cast spells farther than normal.  Benefit: You can alter a spell with a range of close, medium, or long to double the range of the spell. An enlarged spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.  Spells whose ranges are not defined by distance, as well as spells whose ranges are not close, medium, or long, do not have increased ranges. 
TAG_REGENERATION	TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES			Regeneration	Creatures with this extraordinary ability recover from wounds quickly and can even regrow or reattach severed limbs.  Damage dealt to this creature is treated as ~nonlethal damage~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_NONLETHAL_DAMAGE] and the creature automatically cures itself of nonlethal damage at a fixed rate (for example, 5 points per round for a troll).  Certain attack forms, typically fire and acid, deal damage to the creature normally; that sort of damage doesn't convert to nonlethal damage and so doesn't go away.  Delivering a ~coup de grace~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_COUP_DE_GRACE] has a chance of severing the creature's head, killing the creature instantly.
TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES_ABILITY_SCORE_LOSS 	TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES			Ability Score Loss	Various attacks cause ability score loss, either ability damage or ability drain. Points lost to ability damage return at the rate of 1 point per day (or double that if the character gets complete bed rest) to each damaged ability, and the spell ~Lesser Restoration~[TAG_SPELLS_LESSER_RESTORATION] offsets ability damage as well. Ability drain, however, is permanent, though ~Restoration~[TAG_SPELLS_RESTORATION] can restore even those lost ability points.   Having a score of 0 in an ability is different from having no ability score whatsoever. For example, a wraith has no ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] score, not a Strength score of 0. The wraith can move, it just can't act physically on other objects.   Some spells or abilities impose an effective ability score reduction, which is different than ability score loss. Any such reduction disappears at the end of the spell's or ability's duration, and the ability score immediately returns to its former value.  If a character's ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION] score drops, then he or she loses 1 hit point per Hit Die for every point by which his or her Constitution modifier drops. 
TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES_DAMAGE_REDUCTION	TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES			Damage Reduction	Some magic creatures have the supernatural ability to instantly heal damage from weapons or to ignore blows altogether as though they were invulnerable.  The numerical part of a creature's damage reduction is the amount of hit points the creature ignores from normal attacks. Thus, a creature with a damage reduction number of 5 that is struck for 8 points of damage will ignore 5 points and take only 3 points of damage.  Usually, a certain type of weapon can overcome this reduction. This information is separated from the damage reduction by a slash. For example, a salamander's damage reduction is 10/magic, meaning the salamander ignores the first 10 points of damage from every normal attack unless it is made with a magic weapon. If a dash follows the slash (for example, a Large Air Elemental has a DR of 5/-), then the damage reduction is effective against any attack that does not ignore damage reduction. 
TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES_ENERGY_DRAIN_AND_NEGATIVE_LEVELS	TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES			Energy Drain and Negative Levels	Some horrible creatures, especially undead monsters, possess a fearsome supernatural ability to drain levels from those they strike in combat. The creature making an energy drain attack draws a portion of its victim's life force from him.  Most energy drain attacks require a successful melee attack roll--mere physical contact is not enough. Monks, for instance, can pound such creatures with their fists without risking their life energy.   Each successful energy drain attack bestows one or more negative levels on the opponent. A creature takes the following penalties for each negative level it has gained.      -1 on all skill checks and ability checks.     -1 on attack rolls and saving throws.     -5 hit points.     -1 effective level   Negative levels remain for 24 hours or until removed with a spell, such as ~Restoration~[TAG_SPELLS_RESTORATION]. After 24 hours, the afflicted creature must attempt a Fortitude save. If the saving throw succeeds, the negative level goes away with no harm to the creature. The afflicted creature makes a separate saving throw for each negative level it has gained. If the save fails, the negative level goes away, but the creature's level is also reduced by one.
TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES_FAST_HEALING	TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES			Fast Healing	A creature may have the extraordinary ability to regain hit points at an exceptional rate.   At the beginning of each of the creature's turns, it heals a certain number of hit points.  Unlike regeneration, fast healing does not allow a creature to regrow or reattach lost body parts.  A creature that has taken both nonlethal and lethal damage heals the nonlethal damage first.  
TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES_RESISTANCE_TO_ENERGY	TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES			Resistance to Energy	A creature with resistance to energy has the ability (usually extraordinary) to ignore some damage of a certain type (such as cold, electricity, or fire) each round, but it does not have total immunity.  Each resistance ability is defined by what energy type it resists and how many points of damage are resisted. For example, a janni has resistance to fire 10. A janni can ignore the first 10 points of fire damage it takes each attack. It doesn't matter whether the damage has a mundane or magical source.  When resistance completely negates the damage from an energy attack, the attack does not disrupt a spell.  This resistance does not stack with the resistance that a spell, such as ~Endure Elements~[TAG_SPELLS_ENDURE_ELEMENTS], might provide. 
TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES_SPELL_RESISTANCE	TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES			Spell Resistance 	Spell resistance is the extraordinary ability to avoid being affected by spells. (Some spells also grant spell resistance).  To affect a creature that has spell resistance, a spellcaster must make a caster level check at least equal to the creature's spell resistance. If the caster fails the check, the spell doesn't affect the creature.   Only spells and spell-like abilities are subject to spell resistance. Extraordinary and supernatural abilities (including enhancement bonuses on magic weapons) are not. A cleric's spells are subject to spell resistance, but his use of positive or negative energy is not. 
TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES				Creature Special Abilities	A special ability is either extraordinary, spell-like, or supernatural in nature.   -Extraordinary abilities are nonmagical. A monk's ability to evade attacks and a barbarian's uncanny dodge are extraordinary abilities.  -Spell-like abilities, as the name implies, are spells and magical abilities that are very much like spells. Spell-like abilities are subject to spell resistance and ~Dispel Magic~[TAG_SPELLS_DISPEL_MAGIC].  -Supernatural abilities are not subject to spell resistance and do not function in areas where magic is suppressed or negated. [CMD_CHILDREN]

Click on the Pass Time or Rest button after making your selection, or click on Cancel to go back to the game.Note: While you can pass time anywhere, you are only allowed to rest in certain locations (usually at inns, if you pay first, or in the wilderness or in dungeons). If the Rest/Camp icon looks like a watch, you can only pass time. If it looks like a tent, you can rest. You must rest to heal and recover spells. Before resting, look carefully at the tent icon. If the background is green, you can rest safely without interruption. However, if it is yellow, you may have a random encounter while you rest. The type of encounter you have will depend on your location, and you cannot avoid it with the Survival skill.
TAG_CHAR_ABILITIES_UI	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Abilities UI	The interface specifically for your character or characters can be viewed by right-clicking on the character portrait displayed on the bottom of the game screen. In the middle of the interface, you will see a large box with a series of tabs lining the top. The last tab on the right, the one that features a figure with arms spread open, is the Abilities tab. Hovering over the tab itself with your mouse will produce a description of Abilities and then clicking on the tab will open that part of the interface. Here, you will see the following list:Kill Count: the number of enemies that the character has killedDeath Count: the number of times the character has diedCharacter Generation Method (# of Rolls)Mode (will read either Normal or Ironman) 
TAG_CHAR_FEATS_UI	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Feats UI	The Feats interface can be found by either right-clicking on the character portrait in the bottom left-hand side of the game screen, or right-clicking on the character itself, which will bring up the radial menu. With your mouse, hover over the backpack icon, and you will see "Inventory". Selecting this will also open the character interface. Once opened, Feats are located in the row of tabs or icons above the box in the center of the interface, and the tab has a hand pictured on it. Clicking on this tab will open the Feats section of the interface, where the character's feats will be listed, both those that have already been selected in character creation and those that remain future options. If you slide the cursor/arrow over a feat, a short description and any prerequisites required for that feat will be displayed in a text box at the bottom of the interface. 
TAG_HMU_CHAR_INVENTORY_UI	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Inventory UI	Character inventory may be found either by right-clicking on the character portrait at the bottom left corner of the game screen or by right-clicking on the character itself, which will bring up the radial menu. Selecting the backpack icon and then the tab that says "Inventory" will open the interface as well. Available items and armor will be displayed on the left side of the interface, with different colored tabs lining the top. The four tabs along the top allow access to different equipped item configurations, which you can set up in advance and then quickly swap configurations using the tabs. To create a configuration, simply drag items into its positions. When you switch away from a configuration, all equipped items return to your inventory. When you switch back to a configuration, all of its previously equipped items are re-equipped.When hovering on any item, a description will pop up in the blank text box on the bottom of the main interface, which states important characteristics like weight, AC bonuses, damage, etc.Directly to the right is the inventory grid, with the backpack icon on the left side. Click the backpack icon to open the usable inventory screen. To use an item, whether that involves putting new armor on a character or changing a weapon, click in the box on the left that holds the item and drag it into the larger box to the right into any open space. Then, at the bottom, you will see an icon/tab with a hand holding an object. Scrolling over this button will indicate that it is the "use an item" button. Next to this button is another with a hand letting go of an object; this is the "drop an item" button. Drag an item to the Use Item icon and the window will close, then the game acts as if you had selected the item to use from the radial menu. If you drag an item to the Drop Item icon, the item is removed from that character's inventory and placed on the ground at the character's location.Next to these two buttons is a blue box that reads "Total Weight" with a text box displaying the amount of weight that the character currently holds. Scrolling over this number will result in a text message that states whether or not you are ~encumbered~[TAG_ADVENTURING_ENCUMBRANCE].The Inventory interface also shows the amount of money that your character has in his or her possession, directly above the listing of character stats. 
TAG_HMU_CHAR_LOOTING_UI	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Looting UI	The Looting interface is very similar to the ~Bartering~[TAG_HMU_CHAR_BARTERING_UI] interface, with a few exceptions. Instead of an Identify button, there is a TAKE ALL button that enables your character to grab all items off another creature. Also, when scrolling over items that have been looted, there will be no prices listed, as they were not bought. 
TAG_HMU_CHAR_PORTRAIT_UI	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Portrait UI	The Portrait interface is one section of the Character Interface and can be found on the top left side. The Portrait interface has three main parts with corresponding buttons. These buttons are directly underneath the blank box in the top left-hand corner; each displays text when the mouse hovers over to give a short description of its function. First, there is the button that shows the character's 3D model, which is shown in the blank box.

TAG_HMU_CHAR_SKILLS_UI	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Skills UI	Character skills may be found either by right-clicking on the character portrait at the bottom left corner of the game screen or by right-clicking on the actual character, which will bring up the radial menu. Selecting the backpack icon in the radial menu and then the tab that says "Inventory" will open the interface as well. Skills can be found in the character interface, above the large grid in the middle of the interface, by clicking on the tab showing a hammer and anvil. There you will see a list of this particular character's skills and the amount of points in each one. To the right, you can view stats for skill rank,  the key ability and ability modifier, miscellaneous, and the total. Hovering on a skill will result in these numbers showing up in their corresponding boxes, or in the case of a key ability,  the name of the ability will be displayed to the left of the ability modifier. For example, Dexterity is the key ability for Move Silently, and this will appear in a gray box to the left of the modifier. For further detail about the skills, scrolling over a skill name with your mouse will provide a short description of the skill in the text box directly below. 
TAG_HMU_CHAR_STATS_UI	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Stats UI	Personal stats in the character interface may be found either by right-clicking on the character portrait at the bottom left corner of the game screen or by right-clicking on the actual character, which will bring up the radial menu.

TAG_HMU_LOGBOOK_UI_EGO	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Logbook Ego UI	The Ego section of the Logbook keeps track of various party data, including combat stats, damage ranges and similar information. These data are arranged on the left page, with tabs to switch to different ego subsections. The right page shows the actual information. For example, you can select "Creatures Killed" under the Combat tab on the left side of the Ego page. The right side will then list every monster type that you have killed in the game, and tabs on that page will let you sort these monsters by CR, Hit Dice or Name.
TAG_HMU_LOGBOOK_UI_EGO_COMBAT	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Logbook Ego Combat UI	In the Ego section of the Logbook, there are three different tabs displayed on the left side, at the top of the book. The first is Combat. Clicking on this tab will reveal various stats that your character has accrued during combat, including the following:-Creatures Killed-Most Experience from 1 Combat Session-Most Critical Hits-Most Consecutive Misses-Most Kills-Most DeathsThat information can be sorted on the right side of the logbook, according to CR, Hit Dice, or Name of the creatures.

TAG_HMU_LOGBOOK_UI_KEYS	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Logbook Keys UI	The Keys section is similar to the quest and reputation sections in that it shows all keys you have found on the left, and information on the particular selected key on the right. Note: Unlike all other items in the game, keys do not go into personal character inventories, but instead become group communal property listed here in the Logbook. 
TAG_HMU_LOGBOOK_UI_QUESTS	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Logbook Quests UI	The Quests section keeps track of all quests you have accepted or even heard mentioned. The quests are arranged by the location where you received them, and these locations appear as tabs on the top of the left page. Each quest is listed on the left page - you may need to scroll if you have a lot of quests in that location. Select a quest to see its status and a description on the right page. The status of a quest is either Mentioned (you heard about the quest), Accepted (you have agreed to undertake the quest), Completed (you have finished the quest), or Botched (the quest is in a state where you can no longer complete it). You receive experience for a completed quest, and sometimes you can "unbotch" a botched quest. For example, if you are supposed to rescue someone and they are killed, that quest is botched. But if you resurrect the person, the quest will be unbotched and you can try to complete it.
TAG_HMU_LOGBOOK_UI_REPUTATIONS	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Logbook Reputations UI	The Reputations section is similar to the quest section, in that reputations you have acquired on displayed on the left, and information about the reputation on the right.

TAG_HMU_PARTY_POOL_UI	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Party Pool UI	The character pool interface is used for the creation and organization of your party. Once you create a character, the character may be added and listed on screen, with their portrait, name, and main information. There are four buttons lining the top portion of the interface--create, view, modify, and delete. Create will bring you to the character creation interface, where you will roll stats and choose your character's class, race, and other attributes. Clicking on View will bring up a small window that holds information about a particular character in your party (the basic defining traits like class and race, as well as their character stats, etc.) Choosing the button Modify will allow you to change certain aspects of a character. Delete permanently erases the selected character from the party. Toward the bottom of the interface is a button that will either read as Add or Remove, depending on the appropriate action needed. Once a new character is created and listed in the interface, you will need to select Add in order for the character to actually be included in the party. First, click on the desired character's portrait located in the row directly underneath the Add button (the character will be highlighted in blue to indicate the selection), then click Add.If the character's alignment or class does not conflict with the party alignment that was chosen, he or she will be added to the party and highlighted in green to indicate the successful addition. If the character's alignment does conflict, then the character will be highlighted in red, indicating that it is not possible to add that character to the party. Likewise, if there is a conflict regarding class and the alignment of the party (specifically, with ~Paladins~[TAG_PALADINS], as they cannot be added to any parties with evil characters) then that character will not be added.If you would like to exclude a character from your party but not permanently delete them, click on their picture in the portrait row and select Remove. The character will no longer be highlighted in green and is removed from the party, but it will still be listed among the other party members, if you wish to add them again at a later time.
TAG_HMU_PARTY_UI	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Party UI	These portraits represent the controllable characters currently in the party.  If your character is currently under the effects of a condition, you may see Buff indicators above and Ailment indicators below the portrait.  You will also be able to see the character's current Hit Point total in the form of the HP bar.  If you left-click the HP bar, you will see a numerical representation of the character's current and maximum Hit Points on top of the portrait.  Your character's portrait flashes briefly whenever he/she takes damage.Left-clicking a portrait changes the currently selected character (modifiable with the SHIFT key [default key]).Left-clicking a portrait will also change the focus of the Inventory, if the Inventory screen is showing.Left-clicking a Buff or Ailment indicator will open the Help UI to the appropriate topic.By left-clicking and dragging the portraits, you may change the party marching order.By right-clicking a portrait, you may access/close Inventory for that character.These portraits are selectable in combat as targets, much like the portraits in the Combat Initiative UI.If a character is able to level up, due to experience, an indicator will appear to bring up the Level Up UI.If a character in the party dies, an indicator will appear to bring up a Party Dismissal UI.
TAG_HMU_PARTY_UI_HP_BAR	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Party HP Bar UI	Left-clicking on the HP bar will cause the character portrait to display the character's current HP/maximum HP.
TAG_HMU_PC_CREATION_UI	TAG_HMU_ROOT			PC Creation UI	To create a new character, click on the Create button on the Party Pool screen. Character creation requires a series of steps, which you progress through by clicking on buttons on the right side of the screen. As you complete each creation step, the next button will light up, indicating you can click on it and advance to the next stage. At any time during creation, you may back up to an earlier step by clicking on the appropriate button.

TAG_HMU_PC_CREATION_ABILITIES_UI	TAG_HMU_ROOT			PC Creation Abilities UI	You need to select for your character the values of six ability scores: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma. These values are normally generated with four six-sided dice, with the lowest die roll discarded, for a range of 3 to 18. In Normal mode, you can choose to roll (and re-roll) your scores or to buy them directly. Point-buying allows you to customize your character's scores, but random rolling will eventually generate better scores. If you roll, then six values are randomly generated, and you can arrange them any way you like by dragging a number from the right column into an ability score box on the left side. If you don't like the numbers, you can reroll until you're satisfied. However, the game keeps track of the number of rolls you make and displays this number on your character's Info Sheet.You can also buy your ability scores directly in Normal mode. When you use this system, your character begins with all abilities at 8 and you are given 25 points to spend on raising your abilities. Abilities cost 1 point to raise for each score up to 14, 2 points for scores 15 and 16, and 3 points for scores 17 and 18. In Ironman mode, you can only roll your scores (no point buying is available), and you must accept the first roll. You can still choose how to arrange the scores, however.
TAG_HMU_PC_CREATION_ALIGNMENT_UI	TAG_HMU_ROOT			PC Creation Alignment UI	The Alignment interface is basically a boxed grouping of buttons that list the nine different alignments. When creating a party of player characters, the party alignment will limit which characters may adventure together. In selecting one alignment, others that would potentially work with that party alignment will light up. For example, in selecting True Neutral, all of the following alignments light up: Neutral Good, Neutral Evil, Lawful Neutral, and Chaotic Neutral. So in selecting that party alignment, you may only add characters to your party that fall under one of those alignment categories. Once your decision is made, simply click on the chosen button, and then click on the green Accept button. If you change your mind, click the red Cancel button.

Once all ability scores have been dragged to their desired places, you can reassign them, reroll them, or move on to the next stage of character creation. 
TAG_HMU_RANDOM_ENCOUNTER_UI	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Random Encounter UI	When your party uses the WorldMap interface to travel from one location to another, there is a chance that they may have a random encounter. This is measured against a Wilderness Lore check and the computer will then calculate the likelihood. If this does occur, a new interface will pop up in WorldMap, that reads "Wilderness Lore" on the very top. Then, usually, it will have either the type of creature or the type of battle that your party is up against listed directly underneath that. Below this will be a picture icon of the creature and how many creatures are there.

TAG_ADVENTURING_ENCUMBRANCE	TAG_ADVENTURING			Encumbrance	Encumbrance rules determine how much a character's armor and equipment slow him or her down. There are three general weight categories for encumbrance: light, medium, and heavy. The computer will calculate your character's carrying capacity based on his or her Strength score and the amount of weight being carried. The chart below can be used as a basic guideline for encumbrance.Load     Max Dex     Check Penalty     Speed (30 ft.)     Speed (20 ft.)     Run Medium     +3               -3                              20 ft.                    15 ft.                x4Heavy         +1               -6                              20 ft.                    15 ft.                x3In ToEE, if a character's encumbrance level does exceed a heavy load, they will still be allowed to accrue more items. However, their movement will drop to a rate of 5.A dwarf is immune to encumbrance penalties until he or she begins carrying a heavy load. So, a dwarf will continue having a ~movement rate~[TAG_MOVEMENT_RATE] of 20 ft. until they reach this level. However, once they begin carrying a heavy load, dwarves will only be allowed the usual movement rate of 5 for those encumbered at that level. 
TAG_HMU_CHAR_BARTERING_UI	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Bartering UI	The bartering interface looks very similar to the character inventory with an extra pane on the left side for the NPC's inventory. Hovering over any item in your character's inventory will display the price that the NPC will buy it for, and hovering over any item in the NPC's inventory will tell you what the NPC will sell it for.

Yellow means you may rest here, but it is dangerous and you might get attacked while you are sleeping.  Green means that this is a safe place and you may rest for any amount of time.Sometimes the rest icon will change from a tent to a stop-watch.  The stop-watch icon indicates that you can only pass-time here.  While passing time you will not regain spells or health, but you will not get attacked either.Spellcasters like Ariel need 8 hours of rest in order to regain their spells.  The rest icon is green, indicating we are in a safe area, so let's rest.  Here is how to accomplish this:-Left-Click the rest icon.-It is automatically set to 8 hours, so click "rest" to begin.  After clicking "rest", 8 hours will elapse instantly.

If you hover over an enemy, your cursor will change to an attack cursor and the action bar will display how much time it would it take to left-click and attack them.In general, if you keep the bar in the green (above the middle line) you will be able to attack or cast a spell.  If you go into the yellow (below the middle line) you are choosing to do nothing but move the rest of your turn.If the bar is red, it means that this action would take more time than you currently have available.If you use all of your time up, your turn will end automatically.  If you still have some time left and wish to end your turn, you can click on the "end turn button" beneath the action bar or just hit the "enter" key on your keyboard.

TAG_TUT_COMBAT_INITIATIVE_BAR	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Tutorial: Combat Initiative Bar	Combat with a giant rat has begun!  Combat is based on turns and the first thing that needs to be determined is who goes first.  This is called "initiative".  A higher initiative score means you will go before someone with a lower score.  At the top of the game screen during combat, there will be a row of portraits consisting of  your party and all other creatures involved in combat.  A blue border highlights the portrait of the character whose turn it is.  The portraits are listed from left to right in order of initiative.

The walls transform from natural rock to layered brick and stone.  The air grows heavier with every step you take.  There is no question that evil lurks here."
TAG_EX_PALADIN	TAG_PALADINS			Ex-Paladins	A paladin who ceases to be ~lawful good~[TAG_LAWFUL_GOOD], who willfully commits an evil act, or who grossly violates the code of conduct loses all paladin spells and abilities.  She may not progress any farther in levels as a paladin.  She regains her abilities and advancement potential if she atones for her violations.  High ranking ~clerics~[TAG_CLERICS] of good gods can help fallen paladins atone for their past deeds.
TAG_TUT_ROOM2_OVERVIEW	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Area Information	"You enter the room and notice a chest against the wall!  You are suprised to see this chest is in such good repair.  You also notice a sturdy door to the northeast, also appearing in much better condition than the walls surrounding it."
TAG_TUT_ROOM3_OVERVIEW	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Area Information	"Just as you round the corner you see a giant rat in the next room!  The creature seems thin and malnourished, even from this distance.  Even though he may not be at full strength, his size and hunger might make him a serious threat."
TAG_HMU_CHAR_EDITOR_WIZARD_SPEC	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Wizard Specialization UI	In this interface, a wizard will be asked to choose a specialized school of magic. A wizard has the option of choosing such a school by selecting from the list entitled Available Schools. You will drag this school into the box with the heading "Specialized School" and then choose two other schools to be dragged into the Prohibited Schools box that is outlined in red.     An exception to the rules noted above is the school of divination. If divination is chosen as the school that the wizard character will specialize in, then only one school must be selected for the Prohibited Schools box. 
TAG_HMU_CHAR_EDITOR_CLERIC_DOMAINS	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Cleric Domains UI	If you select Cleric as your class, in the class features section you will asked to select a Cleric domain. On the left side of the interface is a listing of domains that you can choose from. On the right side is two empty slots where the selected domains can be dragged over. If you are a neutral cleric with a neutral deity, there will be an additional part of the interface present.

TAG_TUT_LOCKED_DOOR_REMINDER	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Locked Door Information	"This door is locked.  The lock looks much too complex to pick; a key will be necessary to get through."

TAG_TUT_CAST_SPELLS_MAGIC_MISSILE	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Tutorial: Casting Magic Missile	You are now in spell casting mode!  Some spells can have multiple targets, such as Magic Missile, so you will need to select as many targets as your cursor indicates before the spell will be cast. For example, you can left-click on more than one zombie, and designate magic missiles for each of them!  A number will appear on your target when you left-click on them.  This lets you know how many missiles this target will be receiving.  Ariel can cast two missiles simultaneously.  Since there are three zombies, do the following:-Left-click on one zombie.-Left click on a different zombie.Once both of Ariel's missiles have been assigned targets, the spell will automatically fire off!
TAG_TUT_ROOM8_OVERVIEW	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Tutorial:  Attack!	Now take your fighter and rush in to finish them off!
TAG_TUT_LOOT_PREFERENCE	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Tutorial:  Looting Preference	You have found a wand of fireballs!  This is a very powerful item and can be used to damage many targets at once.  It is important to know that some items work best  for different classes.  For instance, a sorcerer wearing plate armor will suffer severe penalties when casting spells.  Plate armor would be best for a barbarian because he isn't concerned with casting spells.Your fighter will most likely fail to use the wand correctly.  The wand should definitely go to Ariel.To put an item in any character's inventory is easy.  Left-click and hold to grab the item and move it over one of your player's portraits along the bottom of the screen.  Simply let go and the item will appear in his/her inventory.You can switch between players when the inventory screen is active by selecting different player portraits. 
TAG_TUT_LOOT_REMINDER	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Tutorial:  Looting Reminder	Now that the zombies are dead, remember to loot their bodies!  There might be items you need for the next encounter.
TAG_TUT_ROOM9_OVERVIEW	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Area Information	"The groaning and shuffling of a large group of zombies can be heard from the room ahead.  The smell is almost unbearable.  Silhouetting the undead figures is a blazing red light coming from just beyond."
TAG_TUT_WAND_USE	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Tutorial:  Using a Wand	This large group of zombies presents a perfect opportunity to have Ariel use the Wand of Fireballs.  Fireball is a spell that deals a large amount of damage to any creature caught in its area of effect.To have Ariel use the wand on the zombies, make sure she alone is selected  by left-clicking on her.  Then access the wand from the radial menu by doing the following:-Right-click  and hover over the inventory tab to reveal all useable objects.-Left-click on the Wand of Fireballs.
TAG_TUT_WAND_FIRE	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Tutorial:  Targeting and Firing the Wand	You now have a large, blue, circular targeting reticle attached to your cursor.  If you move your mouse over the room the zombies are in, you will see an effect ring appear around every zombie within the circular sphere of influence.  This is indicating who will be affected by the spell if it cast in this location.  Make sure that you and Ariel are not within the circle or you will take damage as well!Try to get as many of the zombies in the circle as you can and then left-click to fire the spell!After the wand does its damage, use what you have learned to destroy the rest of the zombies!
TAG_HIT_POINTS	TAG_VITALS			Hit Points	Your hit points (or HP) basically determine how much life your character has. The more hit points a character has, the more difficult they are to kill.
TAG_INITIATIVE	TAG_COMBAT			Initiative	Your character's initiative is a number assigned by the computer that determines when will you take your turn in combat (as well as determining the order that everyone else will take their turns).
TAG_MOVEMENT_RATE	TAG_MOVEMENT_ACTION			Movement Rate	Movement rate is the speed at which your character moves, which may vary according to ~race~[TAG_RACES] and/or level of ~encumbrance~[TAG_ADVENTURING_ENCUMBRANCE]. Dwarves, gnomes, and halflings all move at a base land speed of 20 ft., while humans, elves, half-elves, and half-orcs all move at a base land speed of 30 ft. 
TAG_HEIGHT	TAG_VITALS			Height	The height of your character simply provides a more accurate visual representation within the game. For example, if your character is a halfling, he or she will appear significantly shorter than the rest of the party. Other than this, height has no other affect upon anything in the game. 
TAG_WEIGHT	TAG_VITALS			Weight	The weight of your character has no affect upon anything in the game. You decide the weight of your character when you choose the height; it is scaled to match height. 
TAG_TOOLS	TAG_EQUIPMENT			Tools	~Thieve's Tools~[TAG_THIEVES_TOOLS]~Thieve's Tools, Masterwork~[TAG_THIEVES_TOOLS_MASTERWORK]~Bardic Instrument~[TAG_BARDIC_INSTRUMENT]~Bardic Instrument, Magical~[TAG_BARDIC_INSTRUMENT_MAGICAL]
TAG_WEAPONS_FLAIL	TAG_WEAPONS			Flail	With a flail, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an enemy. You can also use this weapon to make trip attacks, but you cannot drop the flail to avoid being tripped. 
TAG_WEAPONS_SPIKED_CHAIN	TAG_WEAPONS			Spiked Chain	A spiked chain has reach, so you can strike opponents 10 feet away with it. In addition, unlike most other weapons with reach, it can be used against an adjacent foe.  Because the chain can wrap around an enemy's leg or other limb, you can make trip attacks with it. However, you cannot drop the chain to avoid being tripped.   When using a spiked chain, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an opponent. 
TAG_IMPROVED_TWO_WEAPON_FIGHTING	TAG_FEATS_DES			Improved Two-Weapon Fighting	You are an expert in fighting two-handed.  Prerequisites: ~Dex~[TAG_DEXTERITY] 17, ~Two-Weapon Fighting~[TAG_TWO_FIGHTING], base attack bonus +6.   Benefit: In addition to the standard single extra attack you get with an off-hand weapon, you get a second attack with it, albeit at a -5 penalty.  Normal: Without this feat, you can only get a single extra attack with an off-hand weapon.  Special: A ~fighter~[TAG_FIGHTERS] may selected Improved Two-Weapon Fighting as one of her fighter bonus feats.  A 6th-level ~ranger~[TAG_RANGERS] who has chosen the two-weapon combat style is treated as having Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, even if he does not have the prerequisites for it, but only when he is wearing light or no armor. 
TAG_SPELLS_REINCARNATION	TAG_SPELLS		TAG_DRUID_4	Reincarnation	~Transmutation~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_TRANSMUTATION] Level: ~Drd~[TAG_DRUIDS] 4Range: TouchTarget: Dead creature touchedBring back a dead creature, possibly in another body.
TAG_SPELLS_MORDENKAINENS_PRIVATE_SANCTUM	TAG_SPELLS		TAG_SORCERER_2 TAG_WIZARD_2	Mordenkainen's Private Sanctum	~Abjuration~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_ABJURATION]Level: ~Sor~[TAG_SORCERERS]/~Wiz~[TAG_WIZARDS] 2Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./ 2 levels)Target: NoneAllows safe resting in otherwise hostile environments.
TAG_ASSASSIN_NOTE	TAG_DUMMY			Note from Smigmal Redhand	To my most trusted assassin,Lareth has been slain. The fool who did so made a grave mistake, his last. Find and kill this person.  When your task is complete, return to the temple for a new assignment. DO NOT FAIL ME!Smigmal Redhand<directions to the temple are scrawled below>
TAG_BURNE_MAP	TAG_DUMMY			Burne's map	This map specifies the location of  Hommlet and a nearby site labeled "the moat house".
TAG_ALIRA_MAP	TAG_DUMMY			Alira's map	This map specifies the location of  Nulb and a nearby site labeled "the temple".
TAG_FAVORED_CLASS	TAG_CLASSES			Favored Class	A character's favored class does not count against him or her when determining experience point penalties for multiclassing. For example, as a halfling rogue, Lidda can add a second class later on (becoming a multiclass character) without worrying about an XP penalty, because rogue is the favored class for halflings. Note that humans and half-elves do not have a favored class. Instead their highest-level class, whatever it may be, is not counted when determining if there is an experience point penalty for that character.
TAG_TOUCH_ATTACK	TAG_COMBAT			Touch Attack	Touch attacks are used with spells that have a range of touch. To use these spells, you cast the spell and then touch the subject. Since you need only touch your enemy, you make a touch attack instead of a regular attack. Touching an opponent with a touch spell is considered to be an armed attack and therefore does not provoke ~attacks of opportunity~[TAG_AOO] when it is discharged on an armed opponent. However, the act of casting a spell does provoke an attack of opportunity, so you may want to cast the spell and then move to the target instead of vice versa.Touch attacks come in in two types:   -Melee touch attacks: for touches made with your hand   -Ranged touch attacks: for touches made with magic rays, for example.
TAG_NORMAL_DAMAGE	TAG_COMBAT			Normal Damage	When your attack succeeds, whether it be with a weapon, a spell, or another form of combat, you deal damage. Damage reduces a target's current ~hit points~[TAG_HIT_POINTS].
TAG_STOP_CONCENTRATION	TAG_COMBAT			Stop Concentration	You must concentrate to cast a spell. If you are unable to concentrate, the spell can't be cast. If you start casting a spell but something interferes with your concentration, such as a creature taking an ~attack of opportunity~[TAG_AOO]  to hit you with its club, you must make a ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION] check or lose the spell.
TAG_RADIAL_MENU_STAFF_OF_STRIKING	TAG_INGAME			Staff of Striking: Set Charge	This staff is the equivalent of a +3 magic weapon. It causes 4-9 points of damage when a hit is scored. This expends a charge. If 2 charges are expended, bonus damage is doubled; if 3 charges are expended, bonus damage is tripled. No more than 3 charges can be expended per strike. In the radial menu, you will be able to select or "set" how many charges you would like to staff to expend. The staff can be recharged.
TAG_RADIAL_MENU_TALK	TAG_INGAME			Talk	Using "Talk" in the radial menu will allow you to speak to NPCs.
TAG_RADIAL_MENU_READY_COUNTERSPELL	TAG_INGAME			Readying to Counterspell	You may ready a counterspell against a spellcaster. In this case, when the spellcaster starts a spell, you get a chance to identify it with a ~Spellcraft~[TAG_SPELLCRAFT]  check (DC 15 + spell level). If you do, and if you can cast that same spell (are able to cast it and have ti prepared, if you prepare spells), you can cast the spell as counterspell and automatically ruin the other's spellcaster's spell.  A spellcaster can use ~Dispel Magic~[TAG_SPELLS_DISPEL_MAGIC] to counterspell, but it doesn't always work.
TAG_RADIAL_MENU_BREAK_FREE	TAG_INGAME			Break Free	You can break free from a grapple by winning an opposed grapple check in place of making an attack. If more than one opponent is grappling you, your grapple check result has to beat all of their individual check results to escape. If you escape, you finish the action by moving into any space adjacent to your opponent or opponents.
TAG_RANGED_ATTACKS	TAG_COMBAT			Ranged Attacks	With a ranged weapon, you can shoot or throw at any target that is within the weapon's maximum range and in line of sight. The maximum range for a thrown weapon is five range increments. In order to damage your opponent you must succeed at an ~attack roll~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL]
TAG_GOLDEN_SKULL	TAG_MAGIC_ITEMS			Golden Skull	The Orb of Golden Death, or the golden skull, will allow you to teleport to the air, earth, fire, and water nodes. 
TAG_RADIAL_MENU_READY_APPROACH	TAG_INGAME			Ready to Approach	Readying to Approach means that you will make the attack as soon as someone enters your threatened area.
TAG_RADIAL_MENU_READY_WITHDRAWL	TAG_INGAME			Ready vs. Withdrawl	You may also choose to ready an action, dependent on something that the enemy does, such as prepare to cast a spell or shoot a bow. In this case, as soon as the condition is achieved, the character will immediately enact his readied action. If the condition is not achieved, then that character fails to act in that round.Or you may withdraw, in which uou can move away from an opponent at double your ~movement rate~[TAG_MOVEMENT_RATE], without provoking an ~attack of opportunity~[TAG_AOO], using this as a full round action.
TAG_DISMISS_SPELL	TAG_COMBAT			Dismiss Spell	Dismissing an active spell is a ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION] that does not provoke ~attacks of opportunity~[TAG_AOO].  
TAG_THROW_WEAPON	TAG_STANDARD_ACTION			Thrown Weapons	Some weapons can be thrown as an attack.  If you hit, your strength bonus is applied to the damage.  All bonuses and penalties applicable to ranged weapons apply to the thrown weapon.  Throwing a weapon, like any other ranged attack, incurs an attack of opportunity.
TAG_RADIAL_MENU_ACTIVATE_DEFENDING_WEAPON	TAG_INGAME			Activate Defending Weapon	A defending weapon allows the wielder to transfer some or all of the sword's enhancement bonus to his AC as a bonus that stacks with all others. As a free action, the wielder chooses how to allocate the weapon's enhancement bonus at the start of his turn before using the weapon, and the effect to AC lasts until his next turn. 
TAG_CRAFT_MAGIC_ARMS_ARMOR_POPUP	TAG_DUMMY			Craft Magic Arms and Armor PopUp	You need to have a masterwork item in order to use Craft Magic Arms and Armor. 
TAG_TUT_ARIEL_KILL	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Tutorial:  You've Killed Ariel!	Ariel is an extremely helpful spellcaster.  By killing her, you have made it extremely difficult to fight through the rest of this dungeon.  We suggest you begin again, but you may continue on and see how far you can get!
TAG_TUT_LOOT_PREFERENCE_ARIEL_DEAD	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Tutorial:  Looting Preference	You have found a wand of fireballs!  This is a very powerful item and can be used to damage many targets at once.  It is important to know that some items work best  for different classes.  For instance, a sorcerer wearing plate armor will suffer severe penalties when casting spells.  Plate armor would be best for a barbarian because he isn't concerned with casting spells.In the case of wands, fighters are not able to use them at all.  Only if you had a spellcaster with you could you use this extremely powerful item.
TAG_TUT_REST_CAMP_ARIEL_DEAD	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Tutorial: Rest/Camp	Look at the utility bar in the lower right hand corner of the game screen. There is an icon that looks like a tent.  This is the rest icon.  Clicking on this will bring up the rest interface.  Resting will allow you to regain your health, memorize spells, or just let time pass.  You can choose to rest for any amount of time.The rest icon changes colors to indicate if resting is possible or not.  Red means you cannot rest here.  Yellow means you may rest here, but it is dangerous and you might get attacked while you are sleeping.  Green means that this is a safe place and you may rest for any amount of time.Sometimes the rest icon will change from a tent to a stop-watch.  The stop-watch icon indicates that you can only pass-time here.  While passing time you will not regain spells or health, but you will not get attacked either.If you have taken any damage from combat, it is good to rest and regain your health.  Here is how to accomplish this:-Left-Click the rest icon.-It is automatically set to 8 hours, but you want to select the "rest until healed" option.-Click "rest" to begin.

TAG_ARROW_DEFLECTION	TAG_DUMMY			Arrow Deflection	This shield protects the wielder as if he had the Deflect Arrows feat. Once per round when he would normally be struck by a ranged weapon, he can made a DC 20 Reflex save. If the ranged weapon has an enhancement bonus, the DC increases by that amount. If he succeeds, the shield deflects the weapon. He must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to deflect a ranged weapon doesn't count as an action. Exceptional ranged weapons, such as boulders hurled by giants or Melf's acid arrows, can't be deflected.Prerequisites:CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor; Shield; Price +2 bonus.
TAG_BASHING	TAG_DUMMY			Bashing	A shield with this special ability is designed to perform a shield bash. A bashing shield deals damage as if it were a weapon of two size categories larger (a Medium light shield thus deals 1d6 points of damage and a Medium heavy shield deals 1d8 points of damage). The shield acts as a +1 weapon when used to bash. (Only light and heavy shields can have this ability).Prerequisites:CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor; Searing Light; Price +1 bonus.

TAG_ANARCHIC	TAG_DUMMY			Anarchic	An anarchic weapon is chaotically aligned and infused with the power of chaos. It makes the weapon chaos-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against all lawful alignments. It bestows one negative level on any lawful creature attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including Restoration spells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the chaotic power upon their ammunition.Prerequisites:CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor; Chaos Hammer; creator must be chaotic; Price +2 bonus.

TAG_HMU_OPTIONS_UI_QUAD_BLENDING	TAG_HMU_OPTIONS_UI			Quad Blending Option	Quad Blending produces better video quality at the expense of frame rate on some video cards.
TAG_HMU_OPTIONS_UI_GLOSS_MAPPING	TAG_HMU_OPTIONS_UI			Gloss Mapping Option	Some monsters, such as frogs and slimes, use a technique called gloss mapping to make them look shiny.  Disabling this option could result in a frame rate speed up.
TAG_HMU_OPTIONS_UI_HIGH_QUALITY_CLOTH	TAG_HMU_OPTIONS_UI			High Quality Cloth	If enabled, more processor time is spent making cloth and hair in the game animate realisticly. 
TAG_HMU_OPTIONS_UI_PARTICLE_FIDELITY	TAG_HMU_OPTIONS_UI			Particle Fidelity	Some particle systems are scaled depending on the Particle Fidelity setting.  Setting this option to 0 sets the minimum amount of particles used by spells and environmental effects, while a setting of 100 guarantees maximum amount of eye candy.
TAG_HMU_OPTIONS_UI_SHADOW_TYPE	TAG_HMU_OPTIONS_UI			Shadow Type Option	Simple - Shadows for creatures in the game are rendered as a simple circle.Geometry - Shadows for the creatures are rendered as polygons projected onto the ground plane.  Maps - The creatures are rendered onto an off screen buffer and then applied to the scene.Experiment with different options to get the best results for your graphics card.
TAG_HMU_OPTIONS_UI_CONCURRENT_TURNS	TAG_HMU_OPTIONS_UI			Concurrent Turn Options	If this option is enabled, monsters who are able to take turns at the same time will do so. Enabling this option speeds up combat, but may subtlely change certain events.  For example, if you have the combat reflexes feat,  you may not be able to take an attack of opportunity against a second opponent.  Also, if two monsters move into flanking position both may get the bonus while if concurrent turns were disabled only one would get the bonus.
TAG_HMU_OPTIONS_UI_END_TURN_TIME	TAG_HMU_OPTIONS_UI			End Turn with Time Remaining	This option can be enabled in order to speed up combat.Never - If this option is selected, you will have to end each character's turn manually, either by hitting return or by pressing the red next turn button beneath the action bar.5-foot step - A player's turn will end when the character has only a 5 foot step remaining. Move - A player's turn will end if he's only got a move action remaining.  
TAG_HMU_OPTIONS_UI_END_TURN_DEFAULT	TAG_HMU_OPTIONS_UI			End Turn with Default Action	If this option is enabled, the character's turn will end if he has performed a default attack on an opponent.  A default attack is one performed by just clicking on the opponent as opposed to selecting the attack through the radial menu.
TAG_ARCANE_SPELL_FAILURE	TAG_ARCANE_SPELLS			Arcane Spell Failure	Armor interferes with the gestures that a spellcaster must make to cast an arcane spell that has a somatic component.  Arcane spellcasters face the possibility of arcane spell failure if they're wearing armor, so wizards and sorcers usually don't do so.  Bards can wear light armor without incurring any arcane spell failure chance for their bard spells.
TAG_POISON	TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES			Poison	When a character comes into contact with poison he must make an initial Fortitude saving throw.  If he fails, he takes the poisons initial damage (usually ~ability damage~[TAG_ABILITY_DAMAGED]).  Even if he succeeds, he typically faces more damage 1 minute later, which he can avoid with a successful Fortitude saving throw.Poisons Arsenic  Type: Ingested DC 13Initial Damage: 1 ConSecondary Damage: 1d8 ConBlack Adder poisonType: Injury DC 11Initial Damage: 1d6 ConSecondary Damage: 1d6 ConBlack Lotus extractType: Contact DC 20Initial Damage: 3d6 ConSecondary Damage: 3d6 ConBloodrootType: Injury DC 12Initial Damage: 0Secondary Damage: 1d4 Con + 1d3 WisBlue WhinnisType: Injury DC 14Initial Damage: 1 ConSecondary Damage: UnconsciousnessBurnt Othur fumesType: Inhaled DC 18Initial Damage: 1 ConSecondary Damage: 3d6 ConCarrion Crawler brain juiceType: Contact DC 13Initial Damage: ParalysisSecondary Damage: 0Dark Reaver juiceType: Ingested DC 18Initial Damage: 2d6 ConSecondary Damage: 1d6 Con + 1d6 StrDeathbladeType: Injury DC 20Initial Damage: 1d6 ConSecondary Damage: 2d6 ConDragon BileType: Contact DC 26Initial Damage: 3d6 StrSecondary Damage: 0Giant Wasp poisonType: Injury DC 18Initial Damage: 1d6 DexSecondary Damage: 1d6 DexGreenblood oilType: Injury DC Initial Damage: 1 ConSecondary Damage: 1d2 ConId MossType: Ingested DC 14Initial Damage: 1d4 IntSecondary Damage: 2d6 IntInsanity MistType: Inhaled DC 15Initial Damage: 1d4 WisSecondary Damage: 2d6 WisLarge Scorpion venomType: Injury DC 18Initial Damage: 1d6 StrSecondary Damage: 1d6 StrLich dustType: Ingested DC 17Initial Damage: 2d6 StrSecondary Damage: 1d6 StrMalyss root pasteType: Contact DC 16Initial Damage: 1 DexSecondary Damage: 2d4 DexMysticalType: Contact DC 10 + 1/2 caster levelInitial Damage: 1d10 ConSecondary Damage: 1d10 ConNitharitType: Contact DC 13Initial Damage: 0Secondary Damage: 3d6 ConOil of TaggitType: Ingested DC 15Initial Damage: 0Secondary Damage: UnconsciousnessPurple Worm poisonType: Injury DC 24Initial Damage: 1d6 StrSecondary Damage: 2d6 StrQuasit poisonType: Injury DC 13Initial Damage: 1d4 DexSecondary Damage: 2d4 DexSassone leaf residueType: Contact DC 16Initial Damage: 2d12 HPSecondary Damage: 1d6 ConShadow essenceType: Injury DC 17Initial Damage: 1 StrSecondary Damage: 2d6 StrSmall Centipede poisonType: Injury DC 11Initial Damage: 1 StrSecondary Damage: 2d6 StrSpider venomType: Injury DC 14Initial Damage: 1d4 StrSecondary Damage 1d4 StrUngol dustType: Inhaled DC 15Initial Damage: 1 ChaSecondary Damage: 1d6 Cha + 1 ChaViolet FungiType: Contact DC 14Initial Damage: 1d4 Str + 1d4 ConSecondary Damage: 1d4 Str + 1d4 ConYellow moldType: Contact DC 15Initial Damage: 1d6 ConSecondary Damage: 2d6 Con
TAG_CONCEALMENT	TAG_COMBAT			Concealment	Concealment encompasses all circumstances where nothing physically blocks a blow or shot but where something interferes with an attacker's accuracy.  If a defender has concealment, the attacker must pass a concealment check before an attacker is even allowed to make an attack roll.  Some magical effects (such as Blur and Displacement) provide concealment.Partial concealment gives the subject of an attack a 20% chance that the attack is an automatic miss.  If the attacker rolls higher than 20 percent, he has passed the concealment check but still has to hit with a standard attack roll.  Total concealment occurs when the attacker can't see the target, for example when the attacker is blinded or the defender is invisible.  An attacker attacking someone with total concealment has a 50% miss chance.If the attacker has the ~Blind-Fight~[TAG_BLIND_FIGHT] feat, he gets two chances to pass any concealment checks.Some creatures, such as undead, are immune to critical hits.
TAG_CRITICAL_HIT	TAG_COMBAT			Critical Hits	When you make an attack roll and get  a natural 20, you hit regardless of your target's ~Armor Class~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS], and you have scored a threat.  The hit might be a critical hit.  To find out if it's a critical hit, you immediately make a critical roll - another attack roll with all the same modifiers as the attack roll you just made.  If the critical roll also results in a hit against the target's ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS], you original hit is a critical hit.    If the critical roll is a miss, then your hit is just a regular hit.  A critical hit means that you roll your damage twice, with all your usual bonuses, and add the rolls together.  Some weapons have a threat range is greater than 20.  That is, you can score a threat on a lower number.  Longswords, for example, give you a threat on a natural attack roll of 19 or 20.  In such cases, a roll of lower than 20 is not an automatic hit.  Any attack roll that doesn't result in a hit is not a threat.Some weapons, such as battle axes and arrows, deal better than double damage on a critical hit.  Bonus damage represented as extra dice, such as from a ~sneak attack ~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_SNEAK_ATTACK] or a flaming sword, is not multiplied when you score a critical hit.
TAG_ATTACK_ROLL				Attack Rolls	When making attack, a twenty-sided die is rolled to determine if you hit.  Your attack bonus is added to the roll.  If your roll equals or exceeds your opponents ~armor class~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS], you score a hit and roll damage.  If you roll a natural twenty, you may score a ~critical hit~[TAG_CRITICAL_HIT] and may inflict double damage or more.
TAG_CRAFT_STAFF	TAG_FEATS_DES			Craft Staff	You can create magical staves.
TAG_FORGE_RING	TAG_FEATS_DES			Forge Ring	You can create magical rings... THE ONE RING TO RULE THEM ALL.
